The same `map()`, `reduce()` & `filter()` you know and love, but with async iterator functions!

Do `fetch()` networking in loops, resolve Promises, anything async goes. Performance-friendly _by default_.

**Here's what it looks like:**

## API

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

### reduce

Invoke an async reducer function on each item in the given Array,
where the reducer transforms an accumulator value based on each item iterated over.
**Note:** because `reduce()` is order-sensitive, iteration is sequential.

> This is an asynchronous version of `Array.prototype.reduce()`

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to reduce
-   `reducer` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function, gets passed `(accumulator, value, index, array)` and returns a new value for `accumulator`
-   `accumulator` **\[any]** Optional initial accumulator value

**Examples**

```javascript
await reduce(
	['/foo', '/bar', '/baz'],
	async (accumulator, value) => {
		accumulator[v] = await fetch(value);
		return accumulator;
	},
	{}
);
```

Returns **any** final `accumulator` value

### map

Invoke an async transform function on each item in the given Array **in parallel**,
returning the resulting Array of mapped/transformed items.

> This is an asynchronous, parallelized version of `Array.prototype.map()`.

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to map over
-   `mapper` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function, gets passed `(value, index, array)`, returns the new value.

**Examples**

```javascript
await map(
	['foo', 'baz'],
	async v => await fetch(v)
)
```

Returns **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** resulting mapped/transformed values.

### filter

Invoke an async filter function on each item in the given Array **in parallel**,
returning an Array of values for which the filter function returned a truthy value.

> This is an asynchronous, parallelized version of `Array.prototype.filter()`.

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to filter
-   `filterer` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function. Gets passed `(value, index, array)`, returns true to keep the value in the resulting filtered Array.

**Examples**

```javascript
await filter(
	['foo', 'baz'],
	async v => (await fetch(v)).ok
)
```

Returns **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** resulting filtered values

### find

Invoke an async function on each item in the given Array **in parallel**,
 returning the first element predicate returns truthy for.

> This is an asynchronous, parallelized version of `Array.prototype.find()`.

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to find
-   `predicate` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function. Gets passed `(value, index, array)`, returns true to be the find result.

**Examples**

```javascript
await find(
	['foo', 'baz', 'root'],
	async v => (await fetch(v)).name === 'baz'
)
```

Returns **any** resulting find value

### every

Checks if predicate returns truthy for **all** elements of collection **in parallel**.

> This is an asynchronous, parallelized version of `Array.prototype.every()`.

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to iterate over.
-   `predicate` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function. Gets passed `(value, index, array)`, The function invoked per iteration.

## Installation

```
npm install class-validator --save
```

> Note: Please use at least npm@6 when using class-validator as from npm@6 the dependency tree is flatterned what is good for us.

## Usage

Create your class and put some validation decorators on the properties you want to validate:

```javascript
import {validate, validateOrReject, Contains, IsInt, Length, IsEmail, IsFQDN, IsDate, Min, Max} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Length(10, 20)
    title: string;

    @Contains("hello")
    text: string;

    @IsInt()
    @Min(0)
    @Max(10)
    rating: number;

    @IsEmail()
    email: string;

    @IsFQDN()
    site: string;

    @IsDate()
    createDate: Date;

}

let post = new Post();
post.title = "Hello"; // should not pass
post.text = "this is a great post about hell world"; // should not pass
post.rating = 11; // should not pass
post.email = "google.com"; // should not pass
post.site = "googlecom"; // should not pass

validate(post).then(errors => { // errors is an array of validation errors
    if (errors.length > 0) {
        console.log("validation failed. errors: ", errors);
    } else {
        console.log("validation succeed");
    }
});

validateOrReject(post).catch(errors => {
    console.log("Promise rejected (validation failed). Errors: ", errors);
});
// or
async function validateOrRejectExample(input) {
    try {
        await validateOrReject(input);
    } catch (errors) {
        console.log("Caught promise rejection (validation failed). Errors: ", errors)
    }
}
```

### Passing options

The `validate` function optionally expects a `ValidatorOptions` object as a second parameter.

```ts
export interface ValidatorOptions {

    skipMissingProperties?: boolean;
    whitelist?: boolean;
    forbidNonWhitelisted?: boolean;
    groups?: string[];
    dismissDefaultMessages?: boolean;
    validationError?: {
        target?: boolean;
        value?: boolean;
    };

    forbidUnknownValues?: boolean;
}
```

> It's highly advised to enable on `forbidUnknownValues` what prevent unknown objects to pass validation.

## Validation errors

`validate` method returns you an array of `ValidationError` objects. Each `ValidationError` is:

```javascript
{
    target: Object; // Object that was validated.
    property: string; // Object's property that haven't pass validation.
    value: any; // Value that haven't pass a validation.
    constraints?: { // Constraints that failed validation with error messages.
        [type: string]: string;
    };
    children?: ValidationError[]; // Contains all nested validation errors of the property
}
```

In our case, when we validated a Post object, we have such array of ValidationErrors:

```javascript
[{
    target: /* post object */,
    property: "title",
    value: "Hello",
    constraints: {
        length: "$property must be longer than or equal to 10 characters"
    }
}, {
    target: /* post object */,
    property: "text",
    value: "this is a great post about hell world",
    constraints: {
        contains: "text must contain a hello string"
    }
},
// and other errors
]
```

If you don't want a `target` to be exposed in validation errors, there is a special option when you use validator:

```javascript
validator.validate(post, { validationError: { target: false } });
```

This is especially useful when you send errors back over http, and you most probably don't want to expose
the whole target object.

## Validation messages

You can specify validation message in the decorator options and that message will be returned in `ValidationError`
returned by `validate` method in the case that validation for this field fails.

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, {
        message: "Title is too short"
    })
    @MaxLength(50, {
        message: "Title is too long"
    })
    title: string;
}
```

There are few special tokens you can use in your messages:
* `$value` - the value that is being validated
* `$property` - name of the object's property being validated
* `$target` - name of the object's class being validated
* `$constraint1`, `$constraint2`, ... `$constraintN` - constraints defined by specific validation type

Example of usage:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, { // here, $constraint1 will be replaced with "10", and $value with actual supplied value
        message: "Title is too short. Minimal length is $constraint1 characters, but actual is $value"
    })
    @MaxLength(50, { // here, $constraint1 will be replaced with "50", and $value with actual supplied value
        message: "Title is too long. Maximal length is $constraint1 characters, but actual is $value"
    })
    title: string;
}
```

Also you can provide a function, that returns a message. This way allows to create more granular messages:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, {
        message: (args: ValidationArguments) => {
            if (args.value.length === 1) {
                return "Too short, minimum length is 1 character";
            } else {
                return "Too short, minimum length is " + args.constraints[0] + " characters";
            }
        }
    })
    title: string;
}
```

Message function accepts `ValidationArguments` which contains following information:
* `value` - the value that is being validated
* `constraints` - array of constraints defined by specific validation type
* `targetName` - name of the object's class being validated
* `object` - object that is being validated
* `property` - name of the object's property being validated

## Validating arrays

If your field is an array and you want to perform validation of each item in the array you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: string[];
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` array.

## Validating sets

If your field is a set and you want to perform validation of each item in the set you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: Set<string>;
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` set.

## Validating maps

If your field is a map and you want to perform validation of each item in the map you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: Map<string, string>;
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` map.

## Validating nested objects

If your object contains nested objects and you want the validator to perform their validation too, then you need to
use the `@ValidateNested()` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidateNested} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @ValidateNested()
    user: User;

}
```

## Validating promises

If your object contains property with `Promise`-returned value that should be validated, then you need to use the `@ValidatePromise()` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidatePromise, Min} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Min(0)
    @ValidatePromise()
    userId: Promise<number>;

}
```

It also works great with `@ValidateNested` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidateNested, ValidatePromise} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @ValidateNested()
    @ValidatePromise()
    user: Promise<User>;

}
```

## Inheriting Validation decorators

When you define a subclass which extends from another one, the subclass will automatically inherit the parent's decorators. If a property is redefined in the descendant class decorators will be applied on it both from that and the base class.

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";

class BaseContent {

    @IsEmail()
    email: string;

    @IsString()
    password: string;
}

class User extends BaseContent {

    @MinLength(10)
    @MaxLength(20)
    name: string;

    @Contains("hello")
    welcome: string;

    @MinLength(20)
    password: string; /
}

let user = new User();

user.email = "invalid email";  // inherited property
user.password = "too short" // password wil be validated not only against IsString, but against MinLength as well
user.name = "not valid";
user.welcome = "helo";

validate(user).then(errors => {
    // ...
});  // it will return errors for email, title and text properties

```

## Conditional validation

The conditional validation decorator (`@ValidateIf`) can be used to ignore the validators on a property when the provided condition function returns false. The condition function takes the object being validated and must return a `boolean`.

```javascript
import {ValidateIf, IsNotEmpty} from "class-validator";

export class Post {
    otherProperty:string;

    @ValidateIf(o => o.otherProperty === "value")
    @IsNotEmpty()
    example:string;
}
```

In the example above, the validation rules applied to `example` won't be run unless the object's `otherProperty` is `"value"`.

Note that when the condition is false all validation decorators are ignored, including `isDefined`.

## Whitelisting

Even if your object is an instance of a validation class it can contain additional properties that are not defined.
If you do not want to have such properties on your object, pass special flag to `validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { whitelist: true });
```

This will strip all properties that don't have any decorators. If no other decorator is suitable for your property,
you can use @Allow decorator:

```javascript
import {validate, Allow, Min} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Allow()
    title: string;

    @Min(0)
    views: number;

    nonWhitelistedProperty: number;
}

let post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello world!';
post.views = 420;

post.nonWhitelistedProperty = 69;
(post as any).anotherNonWhitelistedProperty = "something";

validate(post).then(errors => {
  // post.nonWhitelistedProperty is not defined
  // (post as any).anotherNonWhitelistedProperty is not defined
  ...
});
````

If you would rather to have an error thrown when any non-whitelisted properties are present, pass another flag to
`validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true });
```

## Passing context to decorators

It's possible to pass a custom object to decorators which will be accessible on the `ValidationError` instance of the property if validation failed.

```ts
import { validate } from 'class-validator';

class MyClass {
	@MinLength(32, {
		message: "EIC code must be at least 32 characters",
		context: {
			errorCode: 1003,
			developerNote: "The validated string must contain 32 or more characters."
		}
	})
	eicCode: string;
}

const model = new MyClass();

validate(model).then(errors => {
    //errors[0].contexts['minLength'].errorCode === 1003
});
```

## Skipping missing properties

Sometimes you may want to skip validation of the properties that does not exist in the validating object. This is
usually desirable when you want to update some parts of the object, and want to validate only updated parts,
but skip everything else, e.g. skip missing properties.
In such situations you will need to pass a special flag to `validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { skipMissingProperties: true });
```

When skipping missing properties, sometimes you want not to skip all missing properties, some of them maybe required
for you, even if skipMissingProperties is set to true. For such cases you should use `@IsDefined()` decorator.
`@IsDefined()` is the only decorator that ignores `skipMissingProperties` option.

## Validation groups

In different situations you may want to use different validation schemas of the same object.
 In such cases you can use validation groups.

```javascript
import {validate, Min, Length} from "class-validator";

export class User {

    @Min(12, {
        groups: ["registration"]
    })
    age: number;

    @Length(2, 20, {
        groups: ["registration", "admin"]
    })
    name: string;
}

let user = new User();
user.age = 10;
user.name = "Alex";

validate(user, {
    groups: ["registration"]
}); // this will not pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: ["admin"]
}); // this will pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: ["registration", "admin"]
}); // this will not pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: undefined // the default
}); // this will not pass validation since all properties get validated regardless of their groups 

validate(user, {
    groups: []
}); // this will not pass validation, (equivalent to 'groups: undefined', see above)
```

There is also a special flag `always: true` in validation options that you can use. This flag says that this validation
must be applied always no matter which group is used.

## Custom validation classes

If you have custom validation logic you can create a *Constraint class*:

1. First create a file, lets say `CustomTextLength.ts`, and define a new class:

    ```javascript
    import {ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    @ValidatorConstraint({ name: "customText", async: false })
    export class CustomTextLength implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

        validate(text: string, args: ValidationArguments) {
            return text.length > 1 && text.length < 10; // for async validations you must return a Promise<boolean> here
        }

        defaultMessage(args: ValidationArguments) { // here you can provide default error message if validation failed
            return "Text ($value) is too short or too long!";
        }

    }
    ```

    We marked our class with `@ValidatorConstraint` decorator.
    You can also supply a validation constraint name - this name will be used as "error type" in ValidationError.
    If you will not supply a constraint name - it will be auto-generated.

    Our class must implement `ValidatorConstraintInterface` interface and its `validate` method,
    which defines validation logic. If validation succeeds, method returns true, otherwise false.
    Custom validator can be asynchronous, if you want to perform validation after some asynchronous
    operations, simply return a promise with boolean inside in `validate` method.

    Also we defined optional method `defaultMessage` which defines a default error message,
    in the case that the decorator's implementation doesn't set an error message.


2. Then you can use your new validation constraint in your class:

    ```javascript
    import {Validate} from "class-validator";
    import {CustomTextLength} from "./CustomTextLength";

    export class Post {

        @Validate(CustomTextLength, {
            message: "Title is too short or long!"
        })
        title: string;

    }
    ```

    Here we set our newly created `CustomTextLength` validation constraint for `Post.title`.

3. And use validator as usual:

    ```javascript
    import {validate} from "class-validator";

    validate(post).then(errors => {
        // ...
    });
    ```

You can also pass constraints to your validator, like this:

```javascript
import {Validate} from "class-validator";
import {CustomTextLength} from "./CustomTextLength";

export class Post {

    @Validate(CustomTextLength, [3, 20], {
        message: "Wrong post title"
    })
    title: string;

}
```

And use them from `validationArguments` object:

```javascript
import {ValidationArguments, ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface} from "class-validator";

@ValidatorConstraint()
export class CustomTextLength implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

    validate(text: string, validationArguments: ValidationArguments) {
        return text.length > validationArguments.constraints[0] && text.length < validationArguments.constraints[1];
    }

}
```

## Custom validation decorators

You can also create a custom decorators. Its the most elegant way of using a custom validations.
Lets create a decorator called `@IsLongerThan`:

1. Create a decorator itself:

    ```javascript
    import {registerDecorator, ValidationOptions, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    export function IsLongerThan(property: string, validationOptions?: ValidationOptions) {
       return function (object: Object, propertyName: string) {
            registerDecorator({
                name: "isLongerThan",
                target: object.constructor,
                propertyName: propertyName,
                constraints: [property],
                options: validationOptions,
                validator: {
                    validate(value: any, args: ValidationArguments) {
                        const [relatedPropertyName] = args.constraints;
                        const relatedValue = (args.object as any)[relatedPropertyName];
                        return  typeof value === "string" &&
                               typeof relatedValue === "string" &&
                               value.length > relatedValue.length; // you can return a Promise<boolean> here as well, if you want to make async validation
                    }
                }
            });
       };
    }
    ```

2. Put it to use:

    ```javascript
    import {IsLongerThan} from "./IsLongerThan";

    export class Post {

        title: string;

        @IsLongerThan("title", {
           /* you can also use additional validation options, like "groups" in your custom validation decorators. "each" is not supported */
           message: "Text must be longer than the title"
        })
        text: string;

    }
    ```

In your custom decorators you can also use `ValidationConstraint`.
Lets create another custom validation decorator called `IsUserAlreadyExist`:

1. Create a ValidationConstraint and decorator:

    ```javascript
    import {registerDecorator, ValidationOptions, ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    @ValidatorConstraint({ async: true })
    export class IsUserAlreadyExistConstraint implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

        validate(userName: any, args: ValidationArguments) {
            return UserRepository.findOneByName(userName).then(user => {
                if (user) return false;
                return true;
            });
        }

    }

    export function IsUserAlreadyExist(validationOptions?: ValidationOptions) {
       return function (object: Object, propertyName: string) {
            registerDecorator({
                target: object.constructor,
                propertyName: propertyName,
                options: validationOptions,
                constraints: [],
                validator: IsUserAlreadyExistConstraint
            });
       };
    }
    ```

    note that we marked our constraint that it will by async by adding `{ async: true }` in validation options.

2. And put it to use:

    ```javascript
    import {IsUserAlreadyExist} from "./IsUserAlreadyExist";

    export class User {

        @IsUserAlreadyExist({
           message: "User $value already exists. Choose another name."
        })
        name: string;

    }
    ```

## Using service container

Validator supports service container in the case if want to inject dependencies into your custom validator constraint
classes. Here is example how to integrate it with [typedi][2]:

```javascript
import {Container} from "typedi";
import {useContainer, Validator} from "class-validator";

// do this somewhere in the global application level:
useContainer(Container);
let validator = Container.get(Validator);

// now everywhere you can inject Validator class which will go from the container
// also you can inject classes using constructor injection into your custom ValidatorConstraint-s
```

## Synchronous validation

If you want to perform a simple non async validation you can use `validateSync` method instead of regular `validate`
 method. It has the same arguments as `validate` method. But note, this method **ignores** all async validations
 you have.

## Manual validation

There are several method exist in the Validator that allows to perform non-decorator based validation:

```javascript
import {Validator} from "class-validator";

// Validation methods
const validator = new Validator();

// common validation methods
validator.isDefined(value); // Checks if value is defined ("!==undefined").
validator.equals(value, comparison); // Checks if value matches ("===") the comparison.

## Validation decorators

| Decorator                                       | Description                                                                                                                      |

## Defining validation schema without decorators

You can define your validation schemas without decorators:

* you can define it in the separate object
* you can define it in the `.json` file

This feature maybe useful in the cases if:

* are using es5/es6 and don't have decorators available
* you don't have a classes, and instead using interfaces
* you don't want to use model at all
* you want to have a validation schema separate of your model
* you want beautiful json-schema based validation models
* you simply hate decorators

Here is an example of using it:

1. Create a schema object:

    ```javascript
    import {ValidationSchema} from "class-validator";
    export let UserValidationSchema: ValidationSchema = { // using interface here is not required, its just for type-safety
        name: "myUserSchema", // this is required, and must be unique
        properties: {
            firstName: [{
                type: "minLength", // validation type. All validation types are listed in ValidationTypes class.
                constraints: [2]
            }, {
                type: "maxLength",
                constraints: [20]
            }],
            lastName: [{
                type: "minLength",
                constraints: [2]
            }, {
                type: "maxLength",
                constraints: [20]
            }],
            email: [{
                type: "isEmail"
            }]
        }
    };
    ```

    Same schema can be provided in `.json` file, depend on your wish.

2. Register your schema:

    ```javascript
    import {registerSchema} from "class-validator";
    import {UserValidationSchema} from "./UserValidationSchema";
    registerSchema(UserValidationSchema); // if schema is in .json file, then you can simply do registerSchema(require("path-to-schema.json"));
    ```

    Better to put this code in a global place, maybe when you bootstrap your application, for example in `app.ts`.

3. Validate your object using validation schema:

    ```javascript
    import {validate} from "class-validator";
    const user = { firstName: "Johny", secondName: "Cage", email: "johny@cage.com" };
    validate("myUserSchema", user).then(errors => {
        if (errors.length > 0) {
            console.log("Validation failed: ", errors);
        } else {
            console.log("Validation succeed.");
        }
    });
    ```

    That's it. Here `"myUserSchema"` is the name of our validation schema.
    `validate` method will perform validation based on this schema

## Validating plain objects
Due to nature of the decorators, the validated object has to be instantiated using `new Class()` syntax. If you have your class defined using class-validator decorators and you want to validate plain JS object (literal object or returned by JSON.parse), you need to transform it to the class instance (e.g. using [class-transformer](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer)) or just use the [class-transformer-validator](https://github.com/19majkel94/class-transformer-validator) extension which can do that for you.

## Samples

Take a look on samples in [./sample](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator/tree/master/sample) for more examples of
usages.

## Extensions
There are several extensions that simplify class-validator integration with other modules:
- [class-validator integration](https://github.com/19majkel94/class-transformer-validator) with [class-transformer](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer)
- [class-validator-rule](https://github.com/yantrab/class-validator-rule)
- [ngx-dynamic-form-builder](https://github.com/EndyKaufman/ngx-dynamic-form-builder)

The following software may be included in this product: consola@2.11.3.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/nuxt/consola (consola@2.11.3). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

<p align="center">
  <h1>üê® Consola</h1>
  <span>Elegant Console Logger for Node.js and Browser</span>
</p>

[![Standard JS][standard-js-src]][standard-js-href]
[![npm version][npm-version-src]][npm-version-href]
[![npm downloads][npm-downloads-src]][npm-downloads-href]
[![package phobia][package-phobia-src]][package-phobia-href]
[![bundle phobia][bundle-phobia-src]][bundle-phobia-href]

## Why Consola?

- Easy to use
- Fancy output with fallback for minimal environments
- Pluggable reporters
- Consistent command line interface (CLI) experience
- Tag support
- Redirect `console` and `stdout/stderr` to the consola and easily restore redirect.
- Browser support
- Pause/Resume support
- Mocking support
- Spam preventation by throttling logs

## Installation

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add consola
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm i consola
```

## Getting Started

```js
const consola = require('consola')

// See types section for all available types

consola.success('Built!')
consola.info('Reporter: Some info')
consola.error(new Error('Foo'))
```

NOTE: Alternatively, you can import consola from source. But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:

```js
import consola from 'consola/src/node'
import consola from 'consola/src/browser'
```

## Methods

#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`

Log to all reporters.

Example: `consola.info('Message')`

A list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).

#### `addReporter(reporter)`

- Aliases: `add`

Register a custom reporter instance.

#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`

- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`

Remove a registered reporter.

If no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.

#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`

Replace all reporters.

#### `create(options)`

Create a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.

#### `withDefaults(defaults)`

Create a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults

#### `withTag(tag)`

- Aliases: `withScope`

Create a new `Consola` instance with that tag.

#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`

Globally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.

#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`

Globally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.

#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`

Wrap both, std and console.

console uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.
Benefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.

#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`

- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`

**Globally** pause and resume logs.

Consola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.

#### `mockTypes`

- Aliases: `mock`

Mock all types. Useful for using with tests.

The first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())
```

Please note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:

```js
const fn = jest.fn()
consola.mockTypes(() => fn)
```

If callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.

For example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn())
```

**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.
This way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.

## Fields

#### `reporters`

An array of active reporters.

#### `level`

The level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.
List of available levels [here](./src/types.js).

You can set log level using `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable.

## `logObject`

The `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.

Standard fields:

- `message`
- `additional`
- `args`
- `date`
- `tag`

Extra fields:

- `badge`

## Reporters

Choose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.

By default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.

Available reporters:

- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)
- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)
- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)
- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)

### Creating your own reporter

A reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.
To get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.

## Types

Types are used to actually log messages to the reporters.
Each type is attached to a _logging level_.

A list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).

## Creating a new instance

Consola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.
In case more control is needed, create a new instance.

```js
import consola from 'consola'

const logger = consola.create({
    // level: 4,
    reporters: [
      new consola.JSONReporter()
    ],
    defaults: {
      additionalColor: 'white'
    }
})
```

## Integrations

### With jest

```js
describe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
      // Redirect std and console to consola too
      // Calling this once is sufficient
      consola.wrapAll()
    })

    beforeEach(() => {
      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove
      // calls from before
      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())
    })


  test('your test', async () => {
    // Some code here

    // Let's retrieve all messages of `consola.log`
    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument
    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])
    expect(consolaMessages).toContain('your message')
  })

})
```

### With jsdom

```js
{
  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)
}
```

A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/vilic/deprecated-decorator (deprecated-decorator@0.1.6). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

[![NPM Package](https://badge.fury.io/js/deprecated-decorator.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deprecated-decorator)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vilic/deprecated-decorator.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vilic/deprecated-decorator) 

# Deprecated Decorator

A simple decorator for deprecated properties, methods and classes. It can also wrap normal functions via the old-fashioned way.

Transpilers supported:

- **TypeScript** with `experimentalDecorators` option enabled.
- **Babel** with [transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) for version 6.x.

## Install

```sh
npm install deprecated-decorator --save
```

## API References

```ts
export declare type DeprecatedDecorator = ClassDecorator & PropertyDecorator;

export interface DeprecatedOptions {
    alternative?: string;
    version?: string;
    url?: string;
}

export declare function deprecated(options?: DeprecatedOptions): DeprecatedDecorator;
export declare function deprecated(alternative?: string, version?: string, url?: string): DeprecatedDecorator;

export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(options: DeprecatedOptions, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, url: string, fn: T): T;

export default deprecated;
```

## Usage

Decorating a class will enable warning on constructor and static methods (including static getters and setters):

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

// alternative, since version, url
@deprecated('Bar', '0.1.0', 'http://vane.life/')
class Foo {
    static method() { }
}
```

Or you can decorate methods respectively:

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

class Foo {
    @deprecated('otherMethod')
    method() { }
    
    @deprecated({
        alternative: 'otherProperty',
        version: '0.1.2',
        url: 'http://vane.life/'
    })
    get property() { }
}
```

For functions:

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

let foo = deprecated({
    alternative: 'bar',
    version: '0.1.0'
}, function foo() {
    // ...
});
```

The following software may be included in this product: fs-capacitor@2.0.4.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor (fs-capacitor@2.0.4). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor) [![Current version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/fs-capacitor)](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) ![Supported Node.js versions](https://badgen.net/npm/node/fs-capacitor)

# FS Capacitor

FS Capacitor is a filesystem buffer for finite node streams. It supports simultaneous read/write, and can be used to create multiple independent readable streams, each starting at the beginning of the buffer.

This is useful for file uploads and other situations where you want to avoid delays to the source stream, but have slow downstream transformations to apply:

```js
import fs from "fs";
import http from "http";
import WriteStream from "fs-capacitor";

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const capacitor = new WriteStream();
  const destination = fs.createReadStream("destination.txt");

  // pipe data to the capacitor
  req.pipe(capacitor);

  // read data from the capacitor
  capacitor
    .createReadStream()
    .pipe(/* some slow Transform streams here */)
    .pipe(destination);

  // read data from the very beginning
  setTimeout(() => {
    capacitor.createReadStream().pipe(/* elsewhere */);

    // you can destroy a capacitor as soon as no more read streams are needed
    // without worrying if existing streams are fully consumed
    capacitor.destroy();
  }, 100);
});
```

It is especially important to use cases like [`graphql-upload`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) where server code may need to stash earler parts of a stream until later parts have been processed, and needs to attach multiple consumers at different times.

FS Capacitor creates its temporary files in the directory ideneified by `os.tmpdir()` and attempts to remove them:

- after `readStream.destroy()` has been called and all read streams are fully consumed or destroyed
- before the process exits

Please do note that FS Capacitor does NOT release disk space _as data is consumed_, and therefore is not suitable for use with infinite streams or those larger than the filesystem.

## API

### WriteStream

`WriteStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.WriteStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_writestream)

#### `new WriteStream()`

Create a new `WriteStream` instance.

#### `.createReadStream(): ReadStream`

Create a new `ReadStream` instance attached to the `WriteStream` instance.

Once a `WriteStream` is fully destroyed, calling `.createReadStream()` will throw a `ReadAfterDestroyedError` error.

As soon as a `ReadStream` ends or is closed (such as by calling `readStream.destroy()`), it is detached from its `WriteStream`.

#### `.destroy(error?: ?Error): void`

- If `error` is present, `WriteStream`s still attached are destroyed with the same error.
- If `error` is null or undefined, destruction of underlying resources is delayed until no `ReadStream`s are attached the `WriteStream` instance.

### ReadStream

`ReadStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.ReadStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_readstream).

# graphql-upload

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/graphql-upload)](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/actions)

Middleware and an [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to add support for [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) (file uploads via queries and mutations) to various Node.js GraphQL servers.

‚ö†Ô∏è Previously published as [`apollo-upload-server`](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-server).

## Support

The following environments are known to be compatible:

- Node.js v8.5+
  - CJS
  - Native ESM with [`--experimental-modules`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_enabling)
- [Koa](https://koajs.com)
  - [`graphql-api-koa`](https://npm.im/graphql-api-koa)
  - [`koa-graphql`](https://npm.im/koa-graphql)
  - [`apollo-server-koa`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-koa) (inbuilt)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - [`express-graphql`](https://npm.im/express-graphql)
  - [`apollo-server-express`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-express) (inbuilt)

See also [GraphQL multipart request spec server implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#server).

## Setup

Setup is necessary if your environment doesn‚Äôt feature this package inbuilt (see **_[Support](#support)_**).

To install [`graphql-upload`](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) and the [`graphql`](https://npm.im/graphql) peer dependency from [npm](https://npmjs.com) run:

```shell
npm install graphql-upload graphql
```

Use the [`graphqlUploadKoa`](#function-graphqluploadkoa) or [`graphqlUploadExpress`](#function-graphqluploadexpress) middleware just before GraphQL middleware. Alternatively, use [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest) to create custom middleware.

A schema built with separate SDL and resolvers (e.g. using [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)) requires the [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to be setup.

## Usage

[Clients implementing the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#client) upload files as [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) query or mutation variables. Their resolver values are promises that resolve [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage. Files are typically streamed into cloud storage but may also be stored in the filesystem.

See the [example API and client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-examples).

### Tips

- The process must have both read and write access to the directory identified by [`os.tmpdir()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_tmpdir).
- The device requires sufficient disk space to buffer the expected number of concurrent upload requests.
- Promisify and await file upload streams in resolvers or the server will send a response to the client before uploads are complete, causing a disconnect.
- Handle file upload promise rejection and stream errors; uploads sometimes fail due to network connectivity issues or impatient users disconnecting.
- Process multiple uploads asynchronously with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise/all) or a more flexible solution where an error in one does not reject them all.
- Only use [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload) _before_ the resolver returns; late calls (e.g. in an unawaited async function or callback) throw an error. Existing streams can still be used after a response is sent, although there are few valid reasons for not awaiting their completion.
- Use [`stream.destroy()`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_destroy_error) when an incomplete stream is no longer needed, or temporary files may not get cleaned up.

## Architecture

The [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) allows a file to be used for multiple query or mutation variables (file deduplication), and for variables to be used in multiple places. GraphQL resolvers need to be able to manage independent file streams. As resolvers are executed asynchronously, it‚Äôs possible they will try to process files in a different order than received in the multipart request.

[`busboy`](https://npm.im/busboy) parses multipart request streams. Once the `operations` and `map` fields have been parsed, [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) values in the GraphQL operations are populated with promises, and the operations are passed down the middleware chain to GraphQL resolvers.

[`fs-capacitor`](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) is used to buffer file uploads to the filesystem and coordinate simultaneous reading and writing. As soon as a file upload‚Äôs contents begins streaming, its data begins buffering to the filesystem and its associated promise resolves. GraphQL resolvers can then create new streams from the buffer by calling [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload). The buffer is destroyed once all streams have ended or closed and the server has responded to the request. Any remaining buffer files will be cleaned when the process exits.

## API

### Table of contents

- [class GraphQLUpload](#class-graphqlupload)
- [function graphqlUploadExpress](#function-graphqluploadexpress)
- [function graphqlUploadKoa](#function-graphqluploadkoa)
- [function processRequest](#function-processrequest)
- [type FileUpload](#type-fileupload)
- [type GraphQLOperation](#type-graphqloperation)

### class GraphQLUpload

A GraphQL `Upload` scalar that can be used in a [`GraphQLSchema`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema). It‚Äôs value in resolvers is a promise that resolves [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage.

#### Examples

_Setup for a schema built with [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)._

> ```js
> import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools'
> import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload'
>
> const typeDefs = `
>   scalar Upload
> `
>
> const resolvers = {
>   Upload: GraphQLUpload
> }
>
> export const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })
> ```

_A manually constructed schema with an image upload mutation._

> ```js
> import { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLBoolean } from 'graphql'
> import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload'
>
> export const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
>   mutation: new GraphQLObjectType({
>     name: 'Mutation',
>     fields: {
>       uploadImage: {
>         description: 'Uploads an image.',
>         type: GraphQLBoolean,
>         args: {
>           image: {
>             description: 'Image file.',
>             type: GraphQLUpload
>           }
>         },
>         async resolve(parent, { image }) {
>           const { filename, mimetype, createReadStream } = await image
>           const stream = createReadStream()
>           // Promisify the stream and store the file, then‚Ä¶
>           return true
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   })
> })
> ```

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Create GraphQL schema and resolvers with TypeScript, using classes and decorators!

[**https://typegraphql.ml/**](https://typegraphql.ml/)
<br>
<br>
[![](https://opencollective.com/typegraphql/donate/button.png?color=white)](https://opencollective.com/typegraphql)

## Motivation

We all know that GraphQL is great and solves many problems we have with REST APIs, like overfetching and underfetching. But developing a GraphQL API in Node.js with TypeScript is sometimes a bit of a pain. Why? Let's take a look at the steps we usually have to take.

First, we create all the GraphQL types in `schema.gql` using SDL. Then we create our data models using [ORM classes](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), which represent our db entities. Then we start to write resolvers for our queries, mutations and fields, but this forces us to first create TS interfaces for all arguments, inputs, and even object types.

Only then can we actually implement the resolvers using weird generic signatures and manually performing common tasks, like validation, authorization and loading dependencies:

```js
export const getRecipesResolver: GraphQLFieldResolver<void, Context, GetRecipesArgs> =
  async (_, args, ctx) => {
    // common tasks repeatable for almost every resolver
    const repository = TypeORM.getRepository(Recipe);
    const auth = Container.get(AuthService);
    await joi.validate(getRecipesSchema, args);
    if (!auth.check(ctx.user)) {
      throw new NotAuthorizedError();
    }

    // our business logic, e.g.:
    return repository.find({ skip: args.offset, take: args.limit });
  };
```

The biggest problem is redundancy in our codebase, which makes it difficult to keep things in sync. To add a new field to our entity, we have to jump through all the files - modify an entity class, the schema, as well as the interface. The same goes for inputs or arguments. It's easy to forget to update one piece or make a mistake with a single type. Also, what if we've made a typo in field name? The rename feature (F2) won't work correctly.

Tools like [GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator) or [graphqlgen](https://github.com/prisma/graphqlgen) only solve the first part - they generate the corresponding interfaces (and resolvers skeletons) for our GraphQL schema but they don't fix the schema <--> models redundancy and developer experience (F2 rename won't work, you have to remember about the codegen watch task in background, etc.), as well as common tasks like validation, authorization, etc.

**TypeGraphQL** comes to address these issues, based on experience from a few years of developing GraphQL APIs in TypeScript. The main idea is to have only one source of truth by defining the schema using classes and some help from decorators. Additional features like dependency injection, validation and auth guards help with common tasks that normally we would have to handle ourselves.

## Introduction

As mentioned, **TypeGraphQL** makes developing GraphQL APIs an enjoyable process, i.e. by defining the schema using only classes and a bit of decorator magic.

So, to create types like object type or input type, we use a kind of DTO classes.
For example, to declare `Recipe` type we simply create a class and annotate it with decorators:

```js
@ObjectType()
class Recipe {
  @Field(type => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field()
  title: string;

  @Field(type => [Rate])
  ratings: Rate[];

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  averageRating?: number;
}
```

And we get the corresponding part of the schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Recipe {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  ratings: [Rate!]!
  averageRating: Float
}
```

Then we can create queries, mutations and field resolvers. For this purpose we use controller-like classes that are called "resolvers" by convention. We can also use awesome features like dependency injection and auth guards:

```js
@Resolver(Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  // dependency injection
  constructor(private recipeService: RecipeService) {}

  @Query(returns => [Recipe])
  recipes() {
    return this.recipeService.findAll();
  }

  @Mutation()
  @Authorized(Roles.Admin) // auth guard
  removeRecipe(@Arg("id") id: string): boolean {
    return this.recipeService.removeById(id);
  }

  @FieldResolver()
  averageRating(@Root() recipe: Recipe) {
    return recipe.ratings.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / recipe.ratings.length;
  }
}
```

And in this simple way we get this part of the schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  recipes: [Recipe!]!
}

type Mutation {
  removeRecipe(id: String!): Boolean!
}
```

## Getting started

A full getting started guide with a simple walkthrough (tutorial) can be found at [getting started docs](https://typegraphql.ml/docs/getting-started.html).

## Video tutorial

If you prefer video tutorials, you can watch [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad)'s [TypeGraphQL video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlma1bBu3Tloe4NyYn9Ko8Gs) on YouTube.

## Documentation

The documentation, installation guide, detailed description of the API and all of its features is [available on the website](https://typegraphql.ml/).

## Examples

You can also check the [examples folder](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples) in this repository for more examples of usage: simple fields resolvers, DI Container support, TypeORM integration, automatic validation, etc.

The [Tests folder](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/tests) might also give you some tips how to get various things done.

## Towards v1.0

The currently released version is a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It is well tested (96% coverage, 8000 lines of test code) and has 95% of the planned features already implemented.

However there's still work to be done before the [1.0.0 release](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/milestone/3) and it's mostly about documentation (website, api reference and jsdoc) and compatibility with the GraphQL spec and other tools.

There are also plans for more features like better TypeORM, Prisma and dataloader integration, custom decorators and metadata annotations support - [the full list of ideas](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"Enhancement+%3Anew%3A") is available on the GitHub repo. You can also keep track of [development's progress on project board](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/projects/1).

I encourage you to give TypeGraphQL a try and experiment with. If you have any questions, you can [ask on gitter](https://gitter.im/type-graphql/Lobby). If you find a bug, please report it as an issue on GitHub. If you have any interesting feature requests, I would be happy to hear about them.

## Support

TypeGraphQL is an MIT-licensed open source project. This framework is a result of the tremendous amount of work - sleepless nights, busy evenings and weekends.

It doesn't have a large company that sits behind - its ongoing development is possible only thanks to the support by the community.
