This software contains the following license and notice below:

# `asyncro` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/asyncro.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/asyncro) [![travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/developit/asyncro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/asyncro)

The same `map()`, `reduce()` & `filter()` you know and love, but with async iterator functions!

Do `fetch()` networking in loops, resolve Promises, anything async goes. Performance-friendly _by default_.

**Here's what it looks like:**

## API

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

### reduce

Invoke an async reducer function on each item in the given Array,
where the reducer transforms an accumulator value based on each item iterated over.
**Note:** because `reduce()` is order-sensitive, iteration is sequential.

> This is an asynchronous version of `Array.prototype.reduce()`

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to reduce
-   `reducer` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function, gets passed `(accumulator, value, index, array)` and returns a new value for `accumulator`
-   `accumulator` **\[any]** Optional initial accumulator value

**Examples**

```javascript
await reduce(
	['/foo', '/bar', '/baz'],
	async (accumulator, value) => {
		accumulator[v] = await fetch(value);
		return accumulator;
	},
	{}
);
```

Returns **any** final `accumulator` value

### map

Invoke an async transform function on each item in the given Array **in parallel**,
returning the resulting Array of mapped/transformed items.

> This is an asynchronous, parallelized version of `Array.prototype.map()`.

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to map over
-   `mapper` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function, gets passed `(value, index, array)`, returns the new value.

**Examples**

```javascript
await map(
	['foo', 'baz'],
	async v => await fetch(v)
)
```

Returns **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** resulting mapped/transformed values.

### filter

Invoke an async filter function on each item in the given Array **in parallel**,
returning an Array of values for which the filter function returned a truthy value.

> This is an asynchronous, parallelized version of `Array.prototype.filter()`.

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to filter
-   `filterer` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function. Gets passed `(value, index, array)`, returns true to keep the value in the resulting filtered Array.

**Examples**

```javascript
await filter(
	['foo', 'baz'],
	async v => (await fetch(v)).ok
)
```

Returns **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** resulting filtered values

### find

Invoke an async function on each item in the given Array **in parallel**,
 returning the first element predicate returns truthy for.

> This is an asynchronous, parallelized version of `Array.prototype.find()`.

**Parameters**

-   `array` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** The Array to find
-   `predicate` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Async function. Gets passed `(value, index, array)`, returns true to be the find result.

**Examples**

```javascript
await find(
	['foo', 'baz', 'root'],
	async v => (await fetch(v)).name === 'baz'
)
```

Returns **any** resulting find value

### every

Checks if predicate returns truthy for **all** elements of collection **in parallel**.

**Parameters**

-   `list` **([Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)> | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)&lt;[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)>)** Array/Object with values that are async functions to invoke.

**Examples**

```javascript
await parallel([
	async () => await fetch('foo'),
	async () => await fetch('baz')

```

Returns **([Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) \| [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object))** same structure as `list` input, but with values now resolved.

### series

Invoke all async functions in an Array or Object **sequentially**, returning the result.

**Parameters**

-   `list` **([Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)> | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)&lt;[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)>)** Array/Object with values that are async functions to invoke.

**Examples**

```javascript
await series([
	async () => await fetch('foo'),
	async () => await fetch('baz')
])
```

Returns **([Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) \| [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object))** same structure as `list` input, but with values now resolved.

## Installation

```
npm install class-validator --save
```

> Note: Please use at least npm@6 when using class-validator as from npm@6 the dependency tree is flatterned what is good for us.

## Usage

Create your class and put some validation decorators on the properties you want to validate:

```javascript
import {validate, validateOrReject, Contains, IsInt, Length, IsEmail, IsFQDN, IsDate, Min, Max} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Length(10, 20)
    title: string;

    @Contains("hello")
    text: string;

    @IsInt()
    @Min(0)
    @Max(10)
    rating: number;

    @IsEmail()
    email: string;

    @IsFQDN()
    site: string;

    @IsDate()
    createDate: Date;

}

let post = new Post();
post.title = "Hello"; // should not pass
post.text = "this is a great post about hell world"; // should not pass
post.rating = 11; // should not pass
post.email = "google.com"; // should not pass
post.site = "googlecom"; // should not pass

validate(post).then(errors => { // errors is an array of validation errors
    if (errors.length > 0) {
        console.log("validation failed. errors: ", errors);
    } else {
        console.log("validation succeed");
    }
});

validateOrReject(post).catch(errors => {
    console.log("Promise rejected (validation failed). Errors: ", errors);
});
// or
async function validateOrRejectExample(input) {
    try {
        await validateOrReject(input);
    } catch (errors) {
        console.log("Caught promise rejection (validation failed). Errors: ", errors)
    }
}
```

### Passing options

The `validate` function optionally expects a `ValidatorOptions` object as a second parameter.

```ts
export interface ValidatorOptions {

    skipMissingProperties?: boolean;
    whitelist?: boolean;
    forbidNonWhitelisted?: boolean;
    groups?: string[];
    dismissDefaultMessages?: boolean;
    validationError?: {
        target?: boolean;
        value?: boolean;
    };

    forbidUnknownValues?: boolean;
}
```

> It's highly advised to enable on `forbidUnknownValues` what prevent unknown objects to pass validation.

## Validation errors

`validate` method returns you an array of `ValidationError` objects. Each `ValidationError` is:

```javascript
{
    target: Object; // Object that was validated.
    property: string; // Object's property that haven't pass validation.
    value: any; // Value that haven't pass a validation.
    constraints?: { // Constraints that failed validation with error messages.
        [type: string]: string;
    };
    children?: ValidationError[]; // Contains all nested validation errors of the property
}
```

In our case, when we validated a Post object, we have such array of ValidationErrors:

```javascript
[{
    target: /* post object */,
    property: "title",
    value: "Hello",
    constraints: {
        length: "$property must be longer than or equal to 10 characters"
    }
}, {
    target: /* post object */,
    property: "text",
    value: "this is a great post about hell world",
    constraints: {
        contains: "text must contain a hello string"
    }
},
// and other errors
]
```

If you don't want a `target` to be exposed in validation errors, there is a special option when you use validator:

```javascript
validator.validate(post, { validationError: { target: false } });
```

This is especially useful when you send errors back over http, and you most probably don't want to expose
the whole target object.

## Validation messages

You can specify validation message in the decorator options and that message will be returned in `ValidationError`
returned by `validate` method in the case that validation for this field fails.

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, {
        message: "Title is too short"
    })
    @MaxLength(50, {
        message: "Title is too long"
    })
    title: string;
}
```

There are few special tokens you can use in your messages:
* `$value` - the value that is being validated
* `$property` - name of the object's property being validated
* `$target` - name of the object's class being validated
* `$constraint1`, `$constraint2`, ... `$constraintN` - constraints defined by specific validation type

Example of usage:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, { // here, $constraint1 will be replaced with "10", and $value with actual supplied value
        message: "Title is too short. Minimal length is $constraint1 characters, but actual is $value"
    })
    @MaxLength(50, { // here, $constraint1 will be replaced with "50", and $value with actual supplied value
        message: "Title is too long. Maximal length is $constraint1 characters, but actual is $value"
    })
    title: string;
}
```

Also you can provide a function, that returns a message. This way allows to create more granular messages:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, {
        message: (args: ValidationArguments) => {
            if (args.value.length === 1) {
                return "Too short, minimum length is 1 character";
            } else {
                return "Too short, minimum length is " + args.constraints[0] + " characters";
            }
        }
    })
    title: string;
}
```

Message function accepts `ValidationArguments` which contains following information:
* `value` - the value that is being validated
* `constraints` - array of constraints defined by specific validation type
* `targetName` - name of the object's class being validated
* `object` - object that is being validated
* `property` - name of the object's property being validated

## Validating arrays

If your field is an array and you want to perform validation of each item in the array you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: string[];
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` array.

## Validating sets

If your field is a set and you want to perform validation of each item in the set you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: Set<string>;
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` set.

## Validating maps

If your field is a map and you want to perform validation of each item in the map you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: Map<string, string>;
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` map.

## Validating nested objects

If your object contains nested objects and you want the validator to perform their validation too, then you need to
use the `@ValidateNested()` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidateNested} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @ValidateNested()
    user: User;

}
```

## Validating promises

If your object contains property with `Promise`-returned value that should be validated, then you need to use the `@ValidatePromise()` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidatePromise, Min} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Min(0)
    @ValidatePromise()
    userId: Promise<number>;

}
```

It also works great with `@ValidateNested` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidateNested, ValidatePromise} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @ValidateNested()
    @ValidatePromise()
    user: Promise<User>;

}
```

## Inheriting Validation decorators

When you define a subclass which extends from another one, the subclass will automatically inherit the parent's decorators. If a property is redefined in the descendant class decorators will be applied on it both from that and the base class.

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";

class BaseContent {

    @IsEmail()
    email: string;

    @IsString()
    password: string;
}

class User extends BaseContent {

    @MinLength(10)
    @MaxLength(20)
    name: string;

    @Contains("hello")
    welcome: string;

    @MinLength(20)
    password: string; /
}

let user = new User();

user.email = "invalid email";  // inherited property
user.password = "too short" // password wil be validated not only against IsString, but against MinLength as well
user.name = "not valid";
user.welcome = "helo";

validate(user).then(errors => {
    // ...
});  // it will return errors for email, title and text properties

```

## Conditional validation

The conditional validation decorator (`@ValidateIf`) can be used to ignore the validators on a property when the provided condition function returns false. The condition function takes the object being validated and must return a `boolean`.

```javascript
import {ValidateIf, IsNotEmpty} from "class-validator";

export class Post {
    otherProperty:string;

    @ValidateIf(o => o.otherProperty === "value")
    @IsNotEmpty()
    example:string;
}
```

In the example above, the validation rules applied to `example` won't be run unless the object's `otherProperty` is `"value"`.

Note that when the condition is false all validation decorators are ignored, including `isDefined`.

## Whitelisting

Even if your object is an instance of a validation class it can contain additional properties that are not defined.
If you do not want to have such properties on your object, pass special flag to `validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { whitelist: true });
```

This will strip all properties that don't have any decorators. If no other decorator is suitable for your property,
you can use @Allow decorator:

```javascript
import {validate, Allow, Min} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Allow()
    title: string;

    @Min(0)
    views: number;

    nonWhitelistedProperty: number;
}

let post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello world!';
post.views = 420;

post.nonWhitelistedProperty = 69;
(post as any).anotherNonWhitelistedProperty = "something";

validate(post).then(errors => {
  // post.nonWhitelistedProperty is not defined
  // (post as any).anotherNonWhitelistedProperty is not defined
  ...
});
````

If you would rather to have an error thrown when any non-whitelisted properties are present, pass another flag to
`validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true });
```

## Passing context to decorators

It's possible to pass a custom object to decorators which will be accessible on the `ValidationError` instance of the property if validation failed.

```ts
import { validate } from 'class-validator';

class MyClass {
	@MinLength(32, {
		message: "EIC code must be at least 32 characters",
		context: {
			errorCode: 1003,
			developerNote: "The validated string must contain 32 or more characters."
		}
	})
	eicCode: string;
}

const model = new MyClass();

validate(model).then(errors => {
    //errors[0].contexts['minLength'].errorCode === 1003
});
```

## Skipping missing properties

Sometimes you may want to skip validation of the properties that does not exist in the validating object. This is
usually desirable when you want to update some parts of the object, and want to validate only updated parts,
but skip everything else, e.g. skip missing properties.
In such situations you will need to pass a special flag to `validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { skipMissingProperties: true });
```

When skipping missing properties, sometimes you want not to skip all missing properties, some of them maybe required
for you, even if skipMissingProperties is set to true. For such cases you should use `@IsDefined()` decorator.
`@IsDefined()` is the only decorator that ignores `skipMissingProperties` option.

## Validation groups

In different situations you may want to use different validation schemas of the same object.
 In such cases you can use validation groups.

```javascript
import {validate, Min, Length} from "class-validator";

export class User {

    @Min(12, {
        groups: ["registration"]
    })
    age: number;

    @Length(2, 20, {
        groups: ["registration", "admin"]
    })
    name: string;
}

let user = new User();
user.age = 10;
user.name = "Alex";

validate(user, {
    groups: ["registration"]
}); // this will not pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: ["admin"]
}); // this will pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: ["registration", "admin"]
}); // this will not pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: undefined // the default
}); // this will not pass validation since all properties get validated regardless of their groups 

validate(user, {
    groups: []
}); // this will not pass validation, (equivalent to 'groups: undefined', see above)
```

There is also a special flag `always: true` in validation options that you can use. This flag says that this validation
must be applied always no matter which group is used.

## Custom validation classes

If you have custom validation logic you can create a *Constraint class*:

1. First create a file, lets say `CustomTextLength.ts`, and define a new class:

    ```javascript
    import {ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    @ValidatorConstraint({ name: "customText", async: false })
    export class CustomTextLength implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

        validate(text: string, args: ValidationArguments) {
            return text.length > 1 && text.length < 10; // for async validations you must return a Promise<boolean> here
        }

        defaultMessage(args: ValidationArguments) { // here you can provide default error message if validation failed
            return "Text ($value) is too short or too long!";
        }

    }
    ```

    We marked our class with `@ValidatorConstraint` decorator.
    You can also supply a validation constraint name - this name will be used as "error type" in ValidationError.
    If you will not supply a constraint name - it will be auto-generated.

    Our class must implement `ValidatorConstraintInterface` interface and its `validate` method,
    which defines validation logic. If validation succeeds, method returns true, otherwise false.
    Custom validator can be asynchronous, if you want to perform validation after some asynchronous
    operations, simply return a promise with boolean inside in `validate` method.

    Also we defined optional method `defaultMessage` which defines a default error message,
    in the case that the decorator's implementation doesn't set an error message.


2. Then you can use your new validation constraint in your class:

    ```javascript
    import {Validate} from "class-validator";
    import {CustomTextLength} from "./CustomTextLength";

    export class Post {

        @Validate(CustomTextLength, {
            message: "Title is too short or long!"
        })
        title: string;

    }
    ```

    Here we set our newly created `CustomTextLength` validation constraint for `Post.title`.

3. And use validator as usual:

    ```javascript
    import {validate} from "class-validator";

    validate(post).then(errors => {
        // ...
    });
    ```

You can also pass constraints to your validator, like this:

```javascript
import {Validate} from "class-validator";
import {CustomTextLength} from "./CustomTextLength";

export class Post {

    @Validate(CustomTextLength, [3, 20], {
        message: "Wrong post title"
    })
    title: string;

}
```

And use them from `validationArguments` object:

```javascript
import {ValidationArguments, ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface} from "class-validator";

@ValidatorConstraint()
export class CustomTextLength implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

    validate(text: string, validationArguments: ValidationArguments) {
        return text.length > validationArguments.constraints[0] && text.length < validationArguments.constraints[1];
    }

}
```

## Custom validation decorators

You can also create a custom decorators. Its the most elegant way of using a custom validations.
Lets create a decorator called `@IsLongerThan`:

1. Create a decorator itself:

    ```javascript
    import {registerDecorator, ValidationOptions, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    export function IsLongerThan(property: string, validationOptions?: ValidationOptions) {
       return function (object: Object, propertyName: string) {
            registerDecorator({
                name: "isLongerThan",
                target: object.constructor,
                propertyName: propertyName,
                constraints: [property],
                options: validationOptions,
                validator: {
                    validate(value: any, args: ValidationArguments) {
                        const [relatedPropertyName] = args.constraints;
                        const relatedValue = (args.object as any)[relatedPropertyName];
                        return  typeof value === "string" &&
                               typeof relatedValue === "string" &&
                               value.length > relatedValue.length; // you can return a Promise<boolean> here as well, if you want to make async validation
                    }
                }
            });
       };
    }
    ```

2. Put it to use:

    ```javascript
    import {IsLongerThan} from "./IsLongerThan";

    export class Post {

        title: string;

        @IsLongerThan("title", {
           /* you can also use additional validation options, like "groups" in your custom validation decorators. "each" is not supported */
           message: "Text must be longer than the title"
        })
        text: string;

    }
    ```

In your custom decorators you can also use `ValidationConstraint`.
Lets create another custom validation decorator called `IsUserAlreadyExist`:

1. Create a ValidationConstraint and decorator:

    ```javascript
    import {registerDecorator, ValidationOptions, ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    @ValidatorConstraint({ async: true })
    export class IsUserAlreadyExistConstraint implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

        validate(userName: any, args: ValidationArguments) {
            return UserRepository.findOneByName(userName).then(user => {
                if (user) return false;
                return true;
            });
        }

    }

    export function IsUserAlreadyExist(validationOptions?: ValidationOptions) {
       return function (object: Object, propertyName: string) {
            registerDecorator({
                target: object.constructor,
                propertyName: propertyName,
                options: validationOptions,
                constraints: [],
                validator: IsUserAlreadyExistConstraint
            });
       };
    }
    ```

    note that we marked our constraint that it will by async by adding `{ async: true }` in validation options.

2. And put it to use:

    ```javascript
    import {IsUserAlreadyExist} from "./IsUserAlreadyExist";

    export class User {

        @IsUserAlreadyExist({
           message: "User $value already exists. Choose another name."
        })
        name: string;

    }
    ```

## Using service container

Validator supports service container in the case if want to inject dependencies into your custom validator constraint
classes. Here is example how to integrate it with [typedi][2]:

```javascript
import {Container} from "typedi";
import {useContainer, Validator} from "class-validator";

// do this somewhere in the global application level:
useContainer(Container);
let validator = Container.get(Validator);

// now everywhere you can inject Validator class which will go from the container
// also you can inject classes using constructor injection into your custom ValidatorConstraint-s
```

## Synchronous validation

If you want to perform a simple non async validation you can use `validateSync` method instead of regular `validate`
 method. It has the same arguments as `validate` method. But note, this method **ignores** all async validations
 you have.

## Manual validation

There are several method exist in the Validator that allows to perform non-decorator based validation:

```javascript
import {Validator} from "class-validator";

// Validation methods
const validator = new Validator();

// common validation methods
validator.isDefined(value); // Checks if value is defined ("!==undefined").
validator.equals(value, comparison); // Checks if value matches ("===") the comparison.
validator.notEquals(value, comparison); // Checks if value does not match ("!==") the comparison.
validator.isEmpty(value); // Checks if given value is empty (=== '', === null, === undefined).
validator.isNotEmpty(value); // Checks if given value is not empty (!== '', !== null, !== undefined).
validator.isIn(value, possibleValues); // Checks if given value is in a array of allowed values.
validator.isNotIn(value, possibleValues); // Checks if given value not in a array of allowed values.

```

## Validation decorators

| Decorator                                       | Description                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Common validation decorators**                                                                                                                                                   |
| `@IsDefined(value: any)`                        | Checks if value is defined (!== undefined, !== null). This is the only decorator that ignores skipMissingProperties option.      |
| `@IsOptional()`                                 | Checks if given value is empty (=== null, === undefined) and if so, ignores all the validators on the property.                         |
| `@Equals(comparison: any)`                      | Checks if value equals ("===") comparison.                                                                                       |
| `@NotEquals(comparison: any)`                   | Checks if value not equal ("!==") comparison.                                                                                    |

## Defining validation schema without decorators

You can define your validation schemas without decorators:

* you can define it in the separate object
* you can define it in the `.json` file

This feature maybe useful in the cases if:

* are using es5/es6 and don't have decorators available
* you don't have a classes, and instead using interfaces
* you don't want to use model at all
* you want to have a validation schema separate of your model
* you want beautiful json-schema based validation models
* you simply hate decorators

Here is an example of using it:

1. Create a schema object:

    ```javascript
    import {ValidationSchema} from "class-validator";
    export let UserValidationSchema: ValidationSchema = { // using interface here is not required, its just for type-safety
        name: "myUserSchema", // this is required, and must be unique
        properties: {
            firstName: [{
                type: "minLength", // validation type. All validation types are listed in ValidationTypes class.
                constraints: [2]
            }, {
                type: "maxLength",
                constraints: [20]
            }],
            lastName: [{
                type: "minLength",
                constraints: [2]
            }, {
                type: "maxLength",
                constraints: [20]
            }],
            email: [{
                type: "isEmail"
            }]
        }
    };
    ```

    Same schema can be provided in `.json` file, depend on your wish.

2. Register your schema:

    ```javascript
    import {registerSchema} from "class-validator";
    import {UserValidationSchema} from "./UserValidationSchema";
    registerSchema(UserValidationSchema); // if schema is in .json file, then you can simply do registerSchema(require("path-to-schema.json"));
    ```

    Better to put this code in a global place, maybe when you bootstrap your application, for example in `app.ts`.

3. Validate your object using validation schema:

    ```javascript
    import {validate} from "class-validator";
    const user = { firstName: "Johny", secondName: "Cage", email: "johny@cage.com" };
    validate("myUserSchema", user).then(errors => {
        if (errors.length > 0) {
            console.log("Validation failed: ", errors);
        } else {
            console.log("Validation succeed.");
        }
    });
    ```

    That's it. Here `"myUserSchema"` is the name of our validation schema.
    `validate` method will perform validation based on this schema

## Validating plain objects
Due to nature of the decorators, the validated object has to be instantiated using `new Class()` syntax. If you have your class defined using class-validator decorators and you want to validate plain JS object (literal object or returned by JSON.parse), you need to transform it to the class instance (e.g. using [class-transformer](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer)) or just use the [class-transformer-validator](https://github.com/19majkel94/class-transformer-validator) extension which can do that for you.

## Samples

Take a look on samples in [./sample](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator/tree/master/sample) for more examples of
usages.

## Extensions
There are several extensions that simplify class-validator integration with other modules:
- [class-validator integration](https://github.com/19majkel94/class-transformer-validator) with [class-transformer](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer)
- [class-validator-rule](https://github.com/yantrab/class-validator-rule)
- [ngx-dynamic-form-builder](https://github.com/EndyKaufman/ngx-dynamic-form-builder)

The following software may be included in this product: consola@2.11.3.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/nuxt/consola (consola@2.11.3). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

<p align="center">
  <h1>🐨 Consola</h1>
  <span>Elegant Console Logger for Node.js and Browser</span>
</p>

[![Standard JS][standard-js-src]][standard-js-href]
[![npm version][npm-version-src]][npm-version-href]
[![npm downloads][npm-downloads-src]][npm-downloads-href]
[![package phobia][package-phobia-src]][package-phobia-href]
[![bundle phobia][bundle-phobia-src]][bundle-phobia-href]

## Why Consola?

- Easy to use
- Fancy output with fallback for minimal environments
- Pluggable reporters
- Consistent command line interface (CLI) experience
- Tag support
- Redirect `console` and `stdout/stderr` to the consola and easily restore redirect.
- Browser support
- Pause/Resume support
- Mocking support
- Spam preventation by throttling logs

## Installation

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add consola
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm i consola
```

## Getting Started

```js
const consola = require('consola')

// See types section for all available types

consola.success('Built!')
consola.info('Reporter: Some info')
consola.error(new Error('Foo'))
```

NOTE: Alternatively, you can import consola from source. But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:

```js
import consola from 'consola/src/node'
import consola from 'consola/src/browser'
```

## Methods

#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`

Log to all reporters.

Example: `consola.info('Message')`

A list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).

#### `addReporter(reporter)`

- Aliases: `add`

Register a custom reporter instance.

#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`

- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`

Remove a registered reporter.

If no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.

#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`

Replace all reporters.

#### `create(options)`

Create a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.

#### `withDefaults(defaults)`

Create a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults

#### `withTag(tag)`

- Aliases: `withScope`

Create a new `Consola` instance with that tag.

#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`

Globally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.

#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`

Globally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.

#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`

Wrap both, std and console.

console uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.
Benefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.

#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`

- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`

**Globally** pause and resume logs.

Consola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.

#### `mockTypes`

- Aliases: `mock`

Mock all types. Useful for using with tests.

The first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())
```

Please note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:

```js
const fn = jest.fn()
consola.mockTypes(() => fn)
```

If callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.

For example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn())
```

**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.
This way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.

## Fields

#### `reporters`

An array of active reporters.

#### `level`

The level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.
List of available levels [here](./src/types.js).

You can set log level using `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable.

## `logObject`

The `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.

Standard fields:

- `message`
- `additional`
- `args`
- `date`
- `tag`

Extra fields:

- `badge`

## Reporters

Choose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.

By default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.

Available reporters:

- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)
- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)
- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)
- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)

### Creating your own reporter

A reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.
To get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.

## Types

Types are used to actually log messages to the reporters.
Each type is attached to a _logging level_.

A list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).

## Creating a new instance

Consola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.
In case more control is needed, create a new instance.

```js
import consola from 'consola'

const logger = consola.create({
    // level: 4,
    reporters: [
      new consola.JSONReporter()
    ],
    defaults: {
      additionalColor: 'white'
    }
})
```

## Integrations

### With jest

```js
describe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
      // Redirect std and console to consola too
      // Calling this once is sufficient
      consola.wrapAll()

A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/vilic/deprecated-decorator (deprecated-decorator@0.1.6). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

[![NPM Package](https://badge.fury.io/js/deprecated-decorator.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deprecated-decorator)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vilic/deprecated-decorator.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vilic/deprecated-decorator) 

# Deprecated Decorator

A simple decorator for deprecated properties, methods and classes. It can also wrap normal functions via the old-fashioned way.

Transpilers supported:

- **TypeScript** with `experimentalDecorators` option enabled.
- **Babel** with [transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) for version 6.x.

## Install

```sh
npm install deprecated-decorator --save
```

## API References

```ts
export declare type DeprecatedDecorator = ClassDecorator & PropertyDecorator;

export interface DeprecatedOptions {
    alternative?: string;
    version?: string;
    url?: string;
}

export declare function deprecated(options?: DeprecatedOptions): DeprecatedDecorator;
export declare function deprecated(alternative?: string, version?: string, url?: string): DeprecatedDecorator;

export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(options: DeprecatedOptions, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, url: string, fn: T): T;

export default deprecated;
```

## Usage

Decorating a class will enable warning on constructor and static methods (including static getters and setters):

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

// alternative, since version, url
@deprecated('Bar', '0.1.0', 'http://vane.life/')
class Foo {
    static method() { }
}
```

Or you can decorate methods respectively:

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

class Foo {
    @deprecated('otherMethod')
    method() { }
    
    @deprecated({
        alternative: 'otherProperty',
        version: '0.1.2',
        url: 'http://vane.life/'
    })
    get property() { }
}
```

For functions:

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

let foo = deprecated({
    alternative: 'bar',
    version: '0.1.0'
}, function foo() {
    // ...
});
```

A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor (fs-capacitor@2.0.4). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor) [![Current version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/fs-capacitor)](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) ![Supported Node.js versions](https://badgen.net/npm/node/fs-capacitor)

# FS Capacitor

FS Capacitor is a filesystem buffer for finite node streams. It supports simultaneous read/write, and can be used to create multiple independent readable streams, each starting at the beginning of the buffer.

This is useful for file uploads and other situations where you want to avoid delays to the source stream, but have slow downstream transformations to apply:

```js
import fs from "fs";
import http from "http";
import WriteStream from "fs-capacitor";

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const capacitor = new WriteStream();
  const destination = fs.createReadStream("destination.txt");

  // pipe data to the capacitor
  req.pipe(capacitor);

  // read data from the capacitor
  capacitor
    .createReadStream()
    .pipe(/* some slow Transform streams here */)
    .pipe(destination);

  // read data from the very beginning
  setTimeout(() => {
    capacitor.createReadStream().pipe(/* elsewhere */);

    // you can destroy a capacitor as soon as no more read streams are needed
    // without worrying if existing streams are fully consumed
    capacitor.destroy();
  }, 100);
});
```

It is especially important to use cases like [`graphql-upload`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) where server code may need to stash earler parts of a stream until later parts have been processed, and needs to attach multiple consumers at different times.

FS Capacitor creates its temporary files in the directory ideneified by `os.tmpdir()` and attempts to remove them:

- after `readStream.destroy()` has been called and all read streams are fully consumed or destroyed
- before the process exits

Please do note that FS Capacitor does NOT release disk space _as data is consumed_, and therefore is not suitable for use with infinite streams or those larger than the filesystem.

## API

### WriteStream

`WriteStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.WriteStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_writestream)

#### `new WriteStream()`

Create a new `WriteStream` instance.

#### `.createReadStream(): ReadStream`

Create a new `ReadStream` instance attached to the `WriteStream` instance.

Once a `WriteStream` is fully destroyed, calling `.createReadStream()` will throw a `ReadAfterDestroyedError` error.

As soon as a `ReadStream` ends or is closed (such as by calling `readStream.destroy()`), it is detached from its `WriteStream`.

#### `.destroy(error?: ?Error): void`

- If `error` is present, `WriteStream`s still attached are destroyed with the same error.
- If `error` is null or undefined, destruction of underlying resources is delayed until no `ReadStream`s are attached the `WriteStream` instance.

### ReadStream

`ReadStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.ReadStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_readstream).

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following software may be included in this product: graphql-upload@8.1.0.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload (graphql-upload@8.1.0). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

![graphql-upload logo](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaydenseric/graphql-upload@8.0.0/graphql-upload-logo.svg)

# graphql-upload

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/graphql-upload)](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/actions)

Middleware and an [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to add support for [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) (file uploads via queries and mutations) to various Node.js GraphQL servers.

⚠️ Previously published as [`apollo-upload-server`](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-server).

## Support

The following environments are known to be compatible:

- Node.js v8.5+
  - CJS
  - Native ESM with [`--experimental-modules`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_enabling)
- [Koa](https://koajs.com)
  - [`graphql-api-koa`](https://npm.im/graphql-api-koa)
  - [`koa-graphql`](https://npm.im/koa-graphql)
  - [`apollo-server-koa`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-koa) (inbuilt)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - [`express-graphql`](https://npm.im/express-graphql)
  - [`apollo-server-express`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-express) (inbuilt)

See also [GraphQL multipart request spec server implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#server).

## Setup

Setup is necessary if your environment doesn’t feature this package inbuilt (see **_[Support](#support)_**).

To install [`graphql-upload`](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) and the [`graphql`](https://npm.im/graphql) peer dependency from [npm](https://npmjs.com) run:

```shell
npm install graphql-upload graphql
```

Use the [`graphqlUploadKoa`](#function-graphqluploadkoa) or [`graphqlUploadExpress`](#function-graphqluploadexpress) middleware just before GraphQL middleware. Alternatively, use [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest) to create custom middleware.

A schema built with separate SDL and resolvers (e.g. using [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)) requires the [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to be setup.

## Usage

[Clients implementing the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#client) upload files as [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) query or mutation variables. Their resolver values are promises that resolve [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage. Files are typically streamed into cloud storage but may also be stored in the filesystem.

See the [example API and client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-examples).

### Tips

- The process must have both read and write access to the directory identified by [`os.tmpdir()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_tmpdir).
- The device requires sufficient disk space to buffer the expected number of concurrent upload requests.
- Promisify and await file upload streams in resolvers or the server will send a response to the client before uploads are complete, causing a disconnect.
- Handle file upload promise rejection and stream errors; uploads sometimes fail due to network connectivity issues or impatient users disconnecting.
- Process multiple uploads asynchronously with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise/all) or a more flexible solution where an error in one does not reject them all.
- Only use [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload) _before_ the resolver returns; late calls (e.g. in an unawaited async function or callback) throw an error. Existing streams can still be used after a response is sent, although there are few valid reasons for not awaiting their completion.
- Use [`stream.destroy()`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_destroy_error) when an incomplete stream is no longer needed, or temporary files may not get cleaned up.

## Architecture

The [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) allows a file to be used for multiple query or mutation variables (file deduplication), and for variables to be used in multiple places. GraphQL resolvers need to be able to manage independent file streams. As resolvers are executed asynchronously, it’s possible they will try to process files in a different order than received in the multipart request.

[`busboy`](https://npm.im/busboy) parses multipart request streams. Once the `operations` and `map` fields have been parsed, [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) values in the GraphQL operations are populated with promises, and the operations are passed down the middleware chain to GraphQL resolvers.

[`fs-capacitor`](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) is used to buffer file uploads to the filesystem and coordinate simultaneous reading and writing. As soon as a file upload’s contents begins streaming, its data begins buffering to the filesystem and its associated promise resolves. GraphQL resolvers can then create new streams from the buffer by calling [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload). The buffer is destroyed once all streams have ended or closed and the server has responded to the request. Any remaining buffer files will be cleaned when the process exits.

## API

### Table of contents

- [class GraphQLUpload](#class-graphqlupload)
- [function graphqlUploadExpress](#function-graphqluploadexpress)
- [function graphqlUploadKoa](#function-graphqluploadkoa)
- [function processRequest](#function-processrequest)
- [type FileUpload](#type-fileupload)
- [type GraphQLOperation](#type-graphqloperation)
- [type ProcessRequestFunction](#type-processrequestfunction)
- [type ProcessRequestOptions](#type-processrequestoptions)

### class GraphQLUpload

A GraphQL `Upload` scalar that can be used in a [`GraphQLSchema`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema). It’s value in resolvers is a promise that resolves [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage.

#### Examples

_Setup for a schema built with [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)._

> ```js
> import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools'
> import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload'
>
> const typeDefs = `
>   scalar Upload
> `
>
> const resolvers = {
>   Upload: GraphQLUpload
> }
>
> export const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })
> ```

_A manually constructed schema with an image upload mutation._

> ```js
> import { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLBoolean } from 'graphql'
> import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload'
>
> export const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
>   mutation: new GraphQLObjectType({
>     name: 'Mutation',
>     fields: {
>       uploadImage: {
>         description: 'Uploads an image.',
>         type: GraphQLBoolean,
>         args: {
>           image: {
>             description: 'Image file.',
>             type: GraphQLUpload
>           }
>         },
>         async resolve(parent, { image }) {
>           const { filename, mimetype, createReadStream } = await image
>           const stream = createReadStream()
>           // Promisify the stream and store the file, then…
>           return true
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   })
> })
> ```

It sets the request body to be [similar to a conventional GraphQL POST request](#type-graphqloperation) for following GraphQL middleware to consume.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `options` | [ProcessRequestOptions](#type-processrequestoptions) | Middleware options. Any [`ProcessRequestOptions`](#type-processrequestoptions) can be used. |
| `options.processRequest` | [ProcessRequestFunction](#type-processrequestfunction)? = [processRequest](#function-processrequest) | Used to process [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec). |

**Returns:** Function — Express middleware.

#### Examples

_Basic [`express-graphql`](https://npm.im/express-graphql) setup._

> ```js
> import express from 'express'
> import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql'
> import { graphqlUploadExpress } from 'graphql-upload'
> import schema from './schema'
>
> express()
>   .use(
>     '/graphql',
>     graphqlUploadExpress({ maxFileSize: 10000000, maxFiles: 10 }),

      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Create GraphQL schema and resolvers with TypeScript, using classes and decorators!

[**https://typegraphql.ml/**](https://typegraphql.ml/)
<br>
<br>
[![](https://opencollective.com/typegraphql/donate/button.png?color=white)](https://opencollective.com/typegraphql)

## Motivation

We all know that GraphQL is great and solves many problems we have with REST APIs, like overfetching and underfetching. But developing a GraphQL API in Node.js with TypeScript is sometimes a bit of a pain. Why? Let's take a look at the steps we usually have to take.

First, we create all the GraphQL types in `schema.gql` using SDL. Then we create our data models using [ORM classes](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), which represent our db entities. Then we start to write resolvers for our queries, mutations and fields, but this forces us to first create TS interfaces for all arguments, inputs, and even object types.

Only then can we actually implement the resolvers using weird generic signatures and manually performing common tasks, like validation, authorization and loading dependencies:

```js
export const getRecipesResolver: GraphQLFieldResolver<void, Context, GetRecipesArgs> =
  async (_, args, ctx) => {
    // common tasks repeatable for almost every resolver
    const repository = TypeORM.getRepository(Recipe);
    const auth = Container.get(AuthService);
    await joi.validate(getRecipesSchema, args);
    if (!auth.check(ctx.user)) {
      throw new NotAuthorizedError();
    }

    // our business logic, e.g.:
    return repository.find({ skip: args.offset, take: args.limit });
  };
```

The biggest problem is redundancy in our codebase, which makes it difficult to keep things in sync. To add a new field to our entity, we have to jump through all the files - modify an entity class, the schema, as well as the interface. The same goes for inputs or arguments. It's easy to forget to update one piece or make a mistake with a single type. Also, what if we've made a typo in field name? The rename feature (F2) won't work correctly.

Tools like [GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator) or [graphqlgen](https://github.com/prisma/graphqlgen) only solve the first part - they generate the corresponding interfaces (and resolvers skeletons) for our GraphQL schema but they don't fix the schema <--> models redundancy and developer experience (F2 rename won't work, you have to remember about the codegen watch task in background, etc.), as well as common tasks like validation, authorization, etc.

**TypeGraphQL** comes to address these issues, based on experience from a few years of developing GraphQL APIs in TypeScript. The main idea is to have only one source of truth by defining the schema using classes and some help from decorators. Additional features like dependency injection, validation and auth guards help with common tasks that normally we would have to handle ourselves.

## Introduction

As mentioned, **TypeGraphQL** makes developing GraphQL APIs an enjoyable process, i.e. by defining the schema using only classes and a bit of decorator magic.

So, to create types like object type or input type, we use a kind of DTO classes.
For example, to declare `Recipe` type we simply create a class and annotate it with decorators:

```js
@ObjectType()
class Recipe {
  @Field(type => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field()
  title: string;

  @Field(type => [Rate])
  ratings: Rate[];

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  averageRating?: number;
}
```

And we get the corresponding part of the schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Recipe {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  ratings: [Rate!]!
  averageRating: Float
}
```

Then we can create queries, mutations and field resolvers. For this purpose we use controller-like classes that are called "resolvers" by convention. We can also use awesome features like dependency injection and auth guards:

```js
@Resolver(Recipe)
class RecipeResolver {
  // dependency injection
  constructor(private recipeService: RecipeService) {}

  @Query(returns => [Recipe])
  recipes() {
    return this.recipeService.findAll();
  }

  @Mutation()
  @Authorized(Roles.Admin) // auth guard
  removeRecipe(@Arg("id") id: string): boolean {
    return this.recipeService.removeById(id);
  }

  @FieldResolver()
  averageRating(@Root() recipe: Recipe) {
    return recipe.ratings.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / recipe.ratings.length;
  }
}
```

And in this simple way we get this part of the schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  recipes: [Recipe!]!
}

type Mutation {
  removeRecipe(id: String!): Boolean!
}
```

## Getting started

A full getting started guide with a simple walkthrough (tutorial) can be found at [getting started docs](https://typegraphql.ml/docs/getting-started.html).

## Video tutorial

If you prefer video tutorials, you can watch [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad)'s [TypeGraphQL video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlma1bBu3Tloe4NyYn9Ko8Gs) on YouTube.

## Documentation

The documentation, installation guide, detailed description of the API and all of its features is [available on the website](https://typegraphql.ml/).

## Examples

You can also check the [examples folder](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples) in this repository for more examples of usage: simple fields resolvers, DI Container support, TypeORM integration, automatic validation, etc.

The [Tests folder](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/tests) might also give you some tips how to get various things done.

## Towards v1.0

The currently released version is a MVP (Minimum Viable Product). It is well tested (96% coverage, 8000 lines of test code) and has 95% of the planned features already implemented.

However there's still work to be done before the [1.0.0 release](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/milestone/3) and it's mostly about documentation (website, api reference and jsdoc) and compatibility with the GraphQL spec and other tools.

There are also plans for more features like better TypeORM, Prisma and dataloader integration, custom decorators and metadata annotations support - [the full list of ideas](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"Enhancement+%3Anew%3A") is available on the GitHub repo. You can also keep track of [development's progress on project board](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/projects/1).

I encourage you to give TypeGraphQL a try and experiment with. If you have any questions, you can [ask on gitter](https://gitter.im/type-graphql/Lobby). If you find a bug, please report it as an issue on GitHub. If you have any interesting feature requests, I would be happy to hear about them.

## Support

TypeGraphQL is an MIT-licensed open source project. This framework is a result of the tremendous amount of work - sleepless nights, busy evenings and weekends.

It doesn't have a large company that sits behind - its ongoing development is possible only thanks to the support by the community.

# Buffer Alloc Unsafe

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.allocUnsafe`.

Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc-unsafe
```

## Usage

```js
const allocUnsafe = require('buffer-alloc-unsafe')

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 78 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 05 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 58 ed bf 5f ff 7f 00 00 01 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 50 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 0a 00>

allocUnsafe(-10)
//=> RangeError: "size" argument must not be negative
```

## API

### allocUnsafe(size)

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes. The `size` must be
less than or equal to the value of `buffer.kMaxLength` and greater than or equal
to zero. Otherwise, a `RangeError` is thrown.

console.log(alloc(10, 'linus', 'utf8'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73 6c 69 6e 75 73>
```

## API

### alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`
- `fill` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; A value to pre-fill the new `Buffer` with. **Default:** `0`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `fill` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`

Allocates a new `Buffer` of `size` bytes. If `fill` is `undefined`, the `Buffer` will be zero-filled.

# Buffer Fill

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.

Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```

## Usage

```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5)

console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>

console.log(buf.fill(9, 2, 4))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 09 09 08>

console.log(buf.fill('linus', 'latin1'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73>

console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```

## API

### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])

- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`

Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.

If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

The following software may be included in this product: seek-bzip@1.0.5.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/cscott/seek-bzip (seek-bzip@1.0.5). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# seek-bzip

[![Build Status][1]][2] [![dependency status][3]][4] [![dev dependency status][5]][6]

`seek-bzip` is a pure-javascript Node.JS module adapted from [node-bzip](https://github.com/skeggse/node-bzip) and before that [antimatter15's pure-javascript bzip2 decoder](https://github.com/antimatter15/bzip2.js).  Like these projects, `seek-bzip` only does decompression (see [compressjs](https://github.com/cscott/compressjs) if you need compression code).  Unlike those other projects, `seek-bzip` can seek to and decode single blocks from the bzip2 file.

`seek-bzip` primarily decodes buffers into other buffers, synchronously.
With the help of the [fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers)
package, it can operate on node streams; see `test/stream.js` for an
example.

## How to Install

```
npm install seek-bzip
```

This package uses
[Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays), which are present in node.js >= 0.5.5.

## Usage

After compressing some example data into `example.bz2`, the following will recreate that original data and save it to `example`:

```
var Bunzip = require('seek-bzip');
var fs = require('fs');

var compressedData = fs.readFileSync('example.bz2');
var data = Bunzip.decode(compressedData);

fs.writeFileSync('example', data);
```

See the tests in the `tests/` directory for further usage examples.

For uncompressing single blocks of bzip2-compressed data, you will need
an out-of-band index listing the start of each bzip2 block.  (Presumably
you generate this at the same time as you index the start of the information
you wish to seek to inside the compressed file.)  The `seek-bzip` module
has been designed to be compatible with the C implementation `seek-bzip2`
available from https://bitbucket.org/james_taylor/seek-bzip2.  That codebase
contains a `bzip-table` tool which will generate bzip2 block start indices.
There is also a pure-JavaScript `seek-bzip-table` tool in this package's
`bin` directory.

## Documentation

`require('seek-bzip')` returns a `Bunzip` object.  It contains three static
methods.  The first is a function accepting one or two parameters:

`Bunzip.decode = function(input, [Number expectedSize] or [output], [boolean multistream])`

The `input` argument can be a "stream" object (which must implement the
`readByte` method), or a `Buffer`.

If `expectedSize` is not present, `decodeBzip` simply decodes `input` and
returns the resulting `Buffer`.

If `expectedSize` is present (and numeric), `decodeBzip` will store
the results in a `Buffer` of length `expectedSize`, and throw an error
in the case that the size of the decoded data does not match
`expectedSize`.

If you pass a non-numeric second parameter, it can either be a `Buffer`
object (which must be of the correct length; an error will be thrown if
the size of the decoded data does not match the buffer length) or
a "stream" object (which must implement a `writeByte` method).

The optional third `multistream` parameter, if true, attempts to continue
reading past the end of the bzip2 file.  This supports "multistream"
bzip2 files, which are simply multiple bzip2 files concatenated together.
If this argument is true, the input stream must have an `eof` method
which returns true when the end of the input has been reached.

The second exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters:

`Bunzip.decodeBlock = function(input, Number blockStartBits, [Number expectedSize] or [output])`

The `input` and `expectedSize`/`output` parameters are as above.
The `blockStartBits` parameter gives the start of the desired block, in bits.

If passing a stream as the `input` parameter, it must implement the
`seek` method.

The final exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters:

`Bunzip.table = function(input, Function callback, [boolean multistream])`

The `input` and `multistream` parameters are identical to those for the
`decode` method.

This function will invoke `callback(position, size)` once per bzip2 block,
where `position` gives the starting position of the block (in *bits*), and
`size` gives the uncompressed size of the block (in bytes).

This can be used to construct an index allowing direct access to a particular
block inside a bzip2 file, using the `decodeBlock` method.

## Command-line
There are binaries available in bin.  The first generates an index of all
the blocks in a bzip2-compressed file:
```
$ bin/seek-bzip-table test/sample4.bz2
32	99981
320555	99981
606348	99981
847568	99981
1089094	99981
1343625	99981
1596228	99981
1843336	99981
2090919	99981
2342106	39019
$
```
The first field is the starting position of the block, in bits, and the
second field is the length of the block, in bytes.

The second binary decodes an arbitrary block of a bzip2 file:
```
$ bin/seek-bunzip -d -b 2342106 test/sample4.bz2 | tail
élan's
émigré
émigré's
émigrés
épée
épée's
épées
étude
étude's
études
$
```

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following software may be included in this product: assert-plus@1.0.0.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus (assert-plus@1.0.0). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date

* assert.optionalArray
* assert.optionalBool
* assert.optionalBuffer
* assert.optionalFunc
* assert.optionalNumber

* assert.optionalArrayOfBool
* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer
* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc
* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber
* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite
* assert.optionalArrayOfObject
* assert.optionalArrayOfString
* assert.optionalArrayOfStream
* assert.optionalArrayOfDate
* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following software may be included in this product: babel-jest@24.9.0.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/facebook/jest (babel-jest@24.9.0). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-jest

[Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) plugin

## Usage

If you are already using `jest-cli`, just add `babel-jest` and it will automatically compile JavaScript code using Babel.

```bash
yarn add --dev babel-jest @babel/core
```

If you would like to write your own preprocessor, uninstall and delete babel-jest and set the [config.transform](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-object-string-string) option to your preprocessor.

## Setup

_Note: this step is only required if you are using `babel-jest` with additional code preprocessors._

To explicitly define `babel-jest` as a transformer for your JavaScript code, map _.js_ files to the `babel-jest` module. Typescript files are also supported.

```json
"transform": {
  "^.+\\.[t|j]sx?$": "babel-jest"
},
```

The following software may be included in this product: bser@2.1.1.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/facebook/watchman (bser@2.1.1). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# BSER Binary Serialization

BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
encoded values.

It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
system filename storage.

For more details about the serialization scheme see
[Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).

## API

```js
var bser = require('bser');
```

### bser.loadFromBuffer

The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,
decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the
input is invalid.

```js
var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);
```

### bser.dumpToBuffer

Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.

```js
var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);
console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']
```

### BunserBuf

The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.
You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the
decoded values via its `value` event.

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log(obj);
});
```

Then in your socket `data` event:

```js
bunser.append(buf);
```

## Example

Read BSER from socket:

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log('data from socket', obj);
});

var socket = net.connect('/socket');

socket.on('data', function(buf) {
  bunser.append(buf);
});
```

Write BSER to socket:

```js
socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));
```

# capture-exit

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/8044m918rwic8b9n/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/embercli/capture-exit/branch/master)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/capture-exit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ember-cli/capture-exit)

Allow cooprative async exit handlers, we unfortunately must hijack
process.exit.

It allows a handler to ensure exit, without that exit handler impeding other
similar handlers

for example, see: [sindresorhus/ora#27](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ora/issues/27)

Differences between `process.on('exit')` and `captureExit.onExit(...)` => https://github.com/ember-cli/capture-exit/issues/12


### Installation

```sh
yarn add capture-exit
// or
npm install --save capture-exit
```

### Usage

```js
// as early in startup as possible
require('capture-exit').captureExit();

// when you want to schedule some work on exit:
function onExit() {
  return something.processWillExit(); // you can return promises, which will pause exit until fulfilled
}

require('capture-exit').onExit(onExit); // add an exit handler
require('capture-exit').offExit(onExit); // allows one to remove an exit handle if it is not longer required
```

The following software may be included in this product: cssstyle@1.4.0.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration (cssstyle@1.4.0). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# CSSStyleDeclaration

[![NpmVersion](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cssstyle.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssstyle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration)

CSSStyleDeclaration is a work-a-like to the CSSStyleDeclaration class in Nikita Vasilyev's [CSSOM](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM). I made it so that when using [jQuery in node](https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery) setting css attributes via $.fn.css() would work. node-jquery uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to create a DOM to use in node. jsdom uses CSSOM for styling, and CSSOM's implementation of the [CSSStyleDeclaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration) doesn't support [CSS2Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties), which is how jQuery's [$.fn.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) operates.

### Why not just issue a pull request?

Well, NV wants to keep CSSOM fast (which I can appreciate) and CSS2Properties aren't required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistance would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires CSSOM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.

### How do I test this code?

`npm test` should do the trick, assuming you have the dev dependencies installed:

```
$ npm test

tests
✔ Verify Has Properties
✔ Verify Has Functions
✔ Verify Has Special Properties
✔ Test From Style String
✔ Test From Properties
✔ Test Shorthand Properties
✔ Test width and height Properties and null and empty strings
✔ Test Implicit Properties
```

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following software may be included in this product: fb-watchman@2.0.1.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/facebook/watchman (fb-watchman@2.0.1). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# fb-watchman

`fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from
Facebook.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very
efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and
filesystem tree querying operations using
[a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).

## Install

You should [install Watchman](
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this
module.

Then simply:

```
$ npm install fb-watchman
```

## Key Concepts

- Watchman recursively watches directories.
- Each watched directory is called a `root`.
- You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes
- Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root)
- change notifications are relative to the project root

## How do I use it?

[Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)

The following software may be included in this product: growly@1.3.0.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/theabraham/growly (growly@1.3.0). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# Growly #

Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.

## Installation ##

Install growly using `npm`:

```
npm install growly
```

And then require it:

```javascript
var growly = require('growly');
```

This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.

## Example ##

Sending a minimal Growl notification:

```javascript
var growly = require('growly');

growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' });
```

More examples can be found in the *example/* directory.

## Usage ##

The growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.

### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###

Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.

  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)
  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.
  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:
    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)
    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)
    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)
  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.

An example:

```javascript
growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [
    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },
    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }
], function(err) {
    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');
});
```

### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###

Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.

  - `text` the body of the notification.
  - `opts` an object with the following properties:
    - `.title` title of the notification.
    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.
    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)
    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)
    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).
    - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.
  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)

An example:

```javascript
/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */
growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {

The following software may be included in this product: imurmurhash@0.1.4.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js (imurmurhash@0.1.4). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

This software contains the following license and notice below:


[Build]:    http://img.shields.io/travis/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png
[Coverage]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/litejs/natural-compare-lite.png
[1]: https://travis-ci.org/litejs/natural-compare-lite
[2]: https://coveralls.io/r/litejs/natural-compare-lite
[npm package]: https://npmjs.org/package/natural-compare-lite
[GitHub repo]: https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite



    @version    1.4.0
    @date       2015-10-26
    @stability  3 - Stable


Natural Compare &ndash; [![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]
===============

Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers
in the way a human being would in sort order.
This is described as a "natural ordering".

```text
Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
    img1.png            img1.png
    img10.png           img2.png
    img12.png           img10.png
    img2.png            img12.png
```

String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
as the given string in sort order.
Use it with builtin sort() function.



### Installation

- In browser

```html
<script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>
```

- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`

```javascript
require("natural-compare-lite")
```

### Usage

```javascript
// Simple case sensitive example
var a = ["z1.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z2.doc", "z23.doc", "z3.doc"];
a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
// ["z1.doc", "z2.doc", "z3.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z23.doc"]

// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
})

// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
var a = [ {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-1021"}
        , {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-21046-b"} ];

// sort by street, then by room
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
})

// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
// it is best for performance to keep
// transformed key in that object.
// There are no need to do text transformation
// on each comparision when sorting.
var a = [ {"make":"Audi", "model":"A6"}
        , {"make":"Kia",  "model":"Rio"} ];

// sort by make, then by model
a.map(function(car){
  car.sort_key = (car.make + " " + car.model).toLowerCase();
})
a.sort(function(a, b){
  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
})
```

- Works well with dates in ISO format eg "Rev 2012-07-26.doc".


### Custom alphabet

It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
to achieve a desired order.

```javascript
// Estonian alphabet
String.alphabet = "ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy"
["t", "z", "x", "õ"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["z", "t", "õ", "x"]

// Russian alphabet
String.alphabet = "АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя"
["Ё", "А", "Б"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
// ["А", "Б", "Ё"]
```

The following software may be included in this product: pn@1.1.0.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/cscott/node-pn (pn@1.1.0). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# pn
[![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]

[![Build Status][1]][2]

The `pn` library gives you the Promise-using node standard library
you've always dreamed of.  Think "Promised Node" when saying it.

Just about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now
return a `Promise` iff no callback is supplied.  But existing code
that passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast:  No unnecessary
`Promise`s are created if you supply a callback.

The wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to
handle exceptions and odd cases.  See below for more details.

## Installation
```
npm install pn
```
## Usage
```
var fs = require('pn/fs');
fs.writeFile('foo', 'bar', 'utf-8').then(function() { console.log('done'); });
// But you can use callbacks, too -- existing code won't break.
fs.writeFile('foo', 'bat', 'utf-8', function(err) { console.log('yay'); });
```

This library uses node native promises (ie `global.Promise`) by
default, and thus works with node >= 0.11.

You can use [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/core-js) or
[`es6-shim`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-shim)
to add ES6 Promises to earlier versions of node, for example:
```
require('es6-shim');
var fs = require('pn/fs');
```
Just be sure that `es6-shim` is loaded before the `pn` package in that
case.

You might also want to look into packages like
[`prfun`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/prfun)
which add some helpers to make working with native promises much more
fun.

In particular, the `Promise#done` method is very useful when
debugging, at least until v8's native Promise debugging
capabilities are completed.

## Custom Promise types

You can also specify a custom `Promise` type to use, as follows:
```
var MyPromise = require('prfun');  // Use prfun's Promises, for example.
require('pn/_promise')(MyPromise); // This only needs to be done once.
```

## Exceptions and odd cases

The wrappers are automatically generated by `scripts/generate.js`;
there is a table in that file which specifies all the odd cases.

In general: if the node API has a callback which takes multiple
value arguments, the `Promise` returned will be an object with
named fields corresponding to the different values. If the node
API takes a callback *and* returns a value, `pn` will return
the original value with a nonenumerable field named `promise`
corresponding to the callback.  Combining these two cases:
```
var child_process = require('pn/child_process');
var cp = child_process.execFile('true');
console.log('pid', cp.pid);
cp.promise.then(function(result) {
  console.log('stdout: ', result.stdout);
  console.log('stderr: ', result.stderr);
});
```

* `child_process`: The `exec` and `execFile` methods promise a object
  with fields named `stdout` and `stderr`.  They return a `ChildProcess`
  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the
  callback.
* `crypto`: The `randomBytes` and `pseudoRandomBytes` methods are
  now always asynchronous, returning a `Promise` if no callback
  is supplied.  Use the new `randomBytesSync` and `pseudoRandomBytesSync`
  methods if you want synchronous computation.  *This is backwards
  incompatible with existing node code.*
* `dns`: The `lookupService` method promises an object with
  fields named `hostname` and `service`.
* `fs`: The `exists` method doesn't pass an error to its callback.
  The promisied version will never reject.  The `write` method promises
  an object with fields named `written` and `data`.  The `read` method
  promises an object with fields named `read` and `data`.
* `http`, `https`: The `request` and `get` methods return a `ClientRequest`
  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise`, which will
  resolve to an `IncomingMessage` object.
* `process`: You can defer computation to the next tick with
  `require('pn/process').nextTick().then(function(){...})`
* `tls`: The `connect` and `createServer` return objects with a
  nonenumerable field named `promise`.

There are a few object methods which are not promisified by this
package:
* `domain`: `Domain#bind`, `Domain#intercept`
* `http`,`https`: `ClientRequest#setTimeout`, `IncomingMessage#setTimeout`,
  `Server#setTimeout`, `ServerResponse#setTimeout`, `Server#listen`,
  `Server#close`
* `net`: `Server#listen`, `Server#close`, `Server#getConnections`,
  `Socket#write`, `Socket#setTimeout`
* `readline`: `Interface#question`
* `stream`: `Writable#write`, `Writable#end`
* `dgram`: `Socket#send`, `Socket#bind`.

## Related packages

Here are some other packages with similar aims:
* [`promised-node`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/promised-node)
* [`then-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/then-fs)
* [`final-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/final-fs)

sane
----

I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers.
Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:

* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive
* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues
* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms
* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:
  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)
  * polling

## Install

```
$ npm install sane
```

## How to choose a mode

Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane
maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.

* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode
* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode
* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`
* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling
* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you

## API

### sane(dir, options)

Watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.

```js
var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});
watcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });
watcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });
watcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });
watcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });
// close
watcher.close();
```

options:

* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.
* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.
* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).
* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.
* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).
* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.
* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.

For the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).
If you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).
If you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).
For the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).

### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)

The default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)

The watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)

The watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.

### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)

The polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:

* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)

### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close

Stops watching.

### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events

Emits the following events:

All events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory
* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory
* `change` when a file changes
* `add` when a file or directory has been added
* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted

## CLI

This module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.

```
Usage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]

OPTIONS:
    --glob=<filePattern>
      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.

    --ignored=<filePattern>
      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.

    --poll, -p
      Use polling mode.

    --watchman, -w
      Use watchman (if available).

    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>
      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).

    --dot, -d
      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.

    --wait=<seconds>
      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled
      after running <command>. Setting this option will
      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.
    --quiet, -q
      Disables sane's console output

    --changes-only, -o
      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup
```

It will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.

### CLI example usage
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --wait=3`
- `sane 'echo "A command ran"' -p`

The following software may be included in this product: uri-js@4.2.2.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/garycourt/uri-js (uri-js@4.2.2). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# URI.js

URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.

URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).

## API

### Parsing

	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  scheme : "uri",
	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
	//  host : "example.com",
	//  port : 123,
	//  path : "/one/two.three",
	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
	//  fragment : "body"
	//}

### Serializing

	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"

### Resolving

	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"

### Normalizing

	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"

### Comparison

	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true

### IP Support

	//IPv4 normalization
	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"

	//IPv6 normalization
	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"

	//IPv6 zone identifier support
	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]");
	//returns:
	//{
	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1"
	//}

### IRI Support

	//convert IRI to URI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
	//convert URI to IRI
	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"

### Options

All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:

*	`scheme` (string)

	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.

*	`reference` (string)

	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.

*	`tolerant` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.

*	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.

*	`iri` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).

*	`domainHost` (boolean, false)

	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).

## Scheme Extendable

URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:

*	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
*	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
*	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
*	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
*	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]

### HTTP Support

	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true

### Mailto Support

	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "mailto",
	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
	//	body : "Sign me up!"
	//}

	URI.serialize({
		scheme : "mailto",
		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
		subject : "REMOVE",
		body : "Please remove me",
		headers : {
			cc : "charlie@example.com"
		}
	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"

### URN Support

	URI.parse("urn:example:foo");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	nss : "foo",
	//}

#### URN UUID Support

	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6");
	//returns:
	//{
	//	scheme : "urn",
	//	nid : "example",
	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
	//}

## Usage

To load in a browser, use the following tag:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>

To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:

	npm install uri-js

Then, in your code, load it using:

	const URI = require("uri-js");

If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:

	import * as URI from "uri-js";

Or you can load just what you need using named exports:

	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";

## Breaking changes

### Breaking changes from 3.x

URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.

The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.

### Breaking changes from 2.x

URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.

### Breaking changes from 1.x

The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
