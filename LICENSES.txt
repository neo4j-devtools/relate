      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

# Buffer Alloc Unsafe

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.allocUnsafe`.

Works as Node.js: `v7.0.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc-unsafe
```

## Usage

```js
const allocUnsafe = require('buffer-alloc-unsafe')

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 78 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 05 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 58 ed bf 5f ff 7f 00 00 01 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 50 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 0a 00>

allocUnsafe(-10)
//=> RangeError: "size" argument must not be negative
```

## API

### allocUnsafe(size)

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes. The `size` must be
less than or equal to the value of `buffer.kMaxLength` and greater than or equal
to zero. Otherwise, a `RangeError` is thrown.

# Buffer Fill

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.

Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```

## Usage

```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')

console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>

console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```

## API

### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])

- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`

Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.

If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

Allows use of decorator and non-decorator based validation.
Internally uses [validator.js][1] to perform validation.
Class-validator works on both browser and node.js platforms.

## Installation

```
npm install class-validator --save
```

> Note: Please use at least npm@6 when using class-validator. From npm@6 the dependency tree is flattened, which is required by `class-validator` to function properly.

## Usage

Create your class and put some validation decorators on the properties you want to validate:

```javascript
import {validate, validateOrReject, Contains, IsInt, Length, IsEmail, IsFQDN, IsDate, Min, Max} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Length(10, 20)
    title: string;

    @Contains("hello")
    text: string;

    @IsInt()
    @Min(0)
    @Max(10)
    rating: number;

    @IsEmail()
    email: string;

    @IsFQDN()
    site: string;

    @IsDate()
    createDate: Date;

}

let post = new Post();
post.title = "Hello"; // should not pass
post.text = "this is a great post about hell world"; // should not pass
post.rating = 11; // should not pass
post.email = "google.com"; // should not pass
post.site = "googlecom"; // should not pass

validate(post).then(errors => { // errors is an array of validation errors
    if (errors.length > 0) {
        console.log("validation failed. errors: ", errors);
    } else {
        console.log("validation succeed");
    }
});

validateOrReject(post).catch(errors => {
    console.log("Promise rejected (validation failed). Errors: ", errors);
});
// or
async function validateOrRejectExample(input) {
    try {
        await validateOrReject(input);
    } catch (errors) {
        console.log("Caught promise rejection (validation failed). Errors: ", errors)
    }
}
```

### Passing options

The `validate` function optionally expects a `ValidatorOptions` object as a second parameter:

```ts
export interface ValidatorOptions {

    skipMissingProperties?: boolean;
    whitelist?: boolean;
    forbidNonWhitelisted?: boolean;
    groups?: string[];
    dismissDefaultMessages?: boolean;
    validationError?: {
        target?: boolean;
        value?: boolean;
    };

    forbidUnknownValues?: boolean;
}
```

> It's highly advised to set `forbidUnknownValues: true` as it will prevent unknown objects from passing validation.

## Validation errors

The `validate` method returns an array of `ValidationError` objects. Each `ValidationError` is:

```javascript
{
    target: Object; // Object that was validated.
    property: string; // Object's property that haven't pass validation.
    value: any; // Value that haven't pass a validation.
    constraints?: { // Constraints that failed validation with error messages.
        [type: string]: string;
    };
    children?: ValidationError[]; // Contains all nested validation errors of the property
}
```

In our case, when we validated a Post object, we have such an array of `ValidationError` objects:

```javascript
[{
    target: /* post object */,
    property: "title",
    value: "Hello",
    constraints: {
        length: "$property must be longer than or equal to 10 characters"
    }
}, {
    target: /* post object */,
    property: "text",
    value: "this is a great post about hell world",
    constraints: {
        contains: "text must contain a hello string"
    }
},
// and other errors
]
```

If you don't want a `target` to be exposed in validation errors, there is a special option when you use validator:

```javascript
validator.validate(post, { validationError: { target: false } });
```

This is especially useful when you send errors back over http, and you most probably don't want to expose
the whole target object.

## Validation messages

You can specify validation message in the decorator options and that message will be returned in the `ValidationError`
returned by the `validate` method (in the case that validation for this field fails).

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, {
        message: "Title is too short"
    })
    @MaxLength(50, {
        message: "Title is too long"
    })
    title: string;
}
```

There are few special tokens you can use in your messages:
* `$value` - the value that is being validated
* `$property` - name of the object's property being validated
* `$target` - name of the object's class being validated
* `$constraint1`, `$constraint2`, ... `$constraintN` - constraints defined by specific validation type

Example of usage:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, { // here, $constraint1 will be replaced with "10", and $value with actual supplied value
        message: "Title is too short. Minimal length is $constraint1 characters, but actual is $value"
    })
    @MaxLength(50, { // here, $constraint1 will be replaced with "50", and $value with actual supplied value
        message: "Title is too long. Maximal length is $constraint1 characters, but actual is $value"
    })
    title: string;
}
```

Also you can provide a function, that returns a message. This allows you to create more granular messages:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MinLength(10, {
        message: (args: ValidationArguments) => {
            if (args.value.length === 1) {
                return "Too short, minimum length is 1 character";
            } else {
                return "Too short, minimum length is " + args.constraints[0] + " characters";
            }
        }
    })
    title: string;
}
```

Message function accepts `ValidationArguments` which contains the following information:
* `value` - the value that is being validated
* `constraints` - array of constraints defined by specific validation type
* `targetName` - name of the object's class being validated
* `object` - object that is being validated
* `property` - name of the object's property being validated

## Validating arrays

If your field is an array and you want to perform validation of each item in the array you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: string[];
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` array.

## Validating sets

If your field is a set and you want to perform validation of each item in the set you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: Set<string>;
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` set.

## Validating maps

If your field is a map and you want to perform validation of each item in the map you must specify a
special `each: true` decorator option:

```javascript
import {MinLength, MaxLength} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @MaxLength(20, {
        each: true
    })
    tags: Map<string, string>;
}
```

This will validate each item in `post.tags` map.

## Validating nested objects

If your object contains nested objects and you want the validator to perform their validation too, then you need to
use the `@ValidateNested()` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidateNested} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @ValidateNested()
    user: User;

}
```

Please note that nested object *must* be an instance of a class, otherwise `@ValidateNested` won't know what class is target of validation. Check also [Validating plain objects](#validating-plain-objects).

It also works with multi-dimensional array, like :

```javascript
import {ValidateNested} from "class-validator";

export class Plan2D {

    @ValidateNested()
    matrix: Point[][];

}
```

## Validating promises

If your object contains property with `Promise`-returned value that should be validated, then you need to use the `@ValidatePromise()` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidatePromise, Min} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Min(0)
    @ValidatePromise()
    userId: Promise<number>;

}
```

It also works great with `@ValidateNested` decorator:

```javascript
import {ValidateNested, ValidatePromise} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @ValidateNested()
    @ValidatePromise()
    user: Promise<User>;

}
```

## Inheriting Validation decorators

When you define a subclass which extends from another one, the subclass will automatically inherit the parent's decorators. If a property is redefined in the descendant class decorators will be applied on it both from that and the base class.

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";

class BaseContent {

    @IsEmail()
    email: string;

    @IsString()
    password: string;
}

class User extends BaseContent {

    @MinLength(10)
    @MaxLength(20)
    name: string;

    @Contains("hello")
    welcome: string;

    @MinLength(20)
    password: string;
}

let user = new User();

user.email = "invalid email";  // inherited property
user.password = "too short" // password wil be validated not only against IsString, but against MinLength as well
user.name = "not valid";
user.welcome = "helo";

validate(user).then(errors => {
    // ...
});  // it will return errors for email, title and text properties

```

## Conditional validation

The conditional validation decorator (`@ValidateIf`) can be used to ignore the validators on a property when the provided condition function returns false. The condition function takes the object being validated and must return a `boolean`.

```javascript
import {ValidateIf, IsNotEmpty} from "class-validator";

export class Post {
    otherProperty:string;

    @ValidateIf(o => o.otherProperty === "value")
    @IsNotEmpty()
    example:string;
}
```

In the example above, the validation rules applied to `example` won't be run unless the object's `otherProperty` is `"value"`.

Note that when the condition is false all validation decorators are ignored, including `isDefined`.

## Whitelisting

Even if your object is an instance of a validation class it can contain additional properties that are not defined.
If you do not want to have such properties on your object, pass special flag to `validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { whitelist: true });
```

This will strip all properties that don't have any decorators. If no other decorator is suitable for your property,
you can use @Allow decorator:

```javascript
import {validate, Allow, Min} from "class-validator";

export class Post {

    @Allow()
    title: string;

    @Min(0)
    views: number;

    nonWhitelistedProperty: number;
}

let post = new Post();
post.title = 'Hello world!';
post.views = 420;

post.nonWhitelistedProperty = 69;
(post as any).anotherNonWhitelistedProperty = "something";

validate(post).then(errors => {
  // post.nonWhitelistedProperty is not defined
  // (post as any).anotherNonWhitelistedProperty is not defined
  ...
});
````

If you would rather to have an error thrown when any non-whitelisted properties are present, pass another flag to
`validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true });
```

## Passing context to decorators

It's possible to pass a custom object to decorators which will be accessible on the `ValidationError` instance of the property if validation failed.

```ts
import { validate } from 'class-validator';

class MyClass {
	@MinLength(32, {
		message: "EIC code must be at least 32 characters",
		context: {
			errorCode: 1003,
			developerNote: "The validated string must contain 32 or more characters."
		}
	})
	eicCode: string;
}

const model = new MyClass();

validate(model).then(errors => {
    //errors[0].contexts['minLength'].errorCode === 1003
});
```

## Skipping missing properties

Sometimes you may want to skip validation of the properties that do not exist in the validating object. This is
usually desirable when you want to update some parts of the object, and want to validate only updated parts,
but skip everything else, e.g. skip missing properties.
In such situations you will need to pass a special flag to `validate` method:

```javascript
import {validate} from "class-validator";
// ...
validate(post, { skipMissingProperties: true });
```

When skipping missing properties, sometimes you want not to skip all missing properties, some of them maybe required
for you, even if skipMissingProperties is set to true. For such cases you should use `@IsDefined()` decorator.
`@IsDefined()` is the only decorator that ignores `skipMissingProperties` option.

## Validation groups

In different situations you may want to use different validation schemas of the same object.
 In such cases you can use validation groups.

```javascript
import {validate, Min, Length} from "class-validator";

export class User {

    @Min(12, {
        groups: ["registration"]
    })
    age: number;

    @Length(2, 20, {
        groups: ["registration", "admin"]
    })
    name: string;
}

let user = new User();
user.age = 10;
user.name = "Alex";

validate(user, {
    groups: ["registration"]
}); // this will not pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: ["admin"]
}); // this will pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: ["registration", "admin"]
}); // this will not pass validation

validate(user, {
    groups: undefined // the default
}); // this will not pass validation since all properties get validated regardless of their groups 

validate(user, {
    groups: []
}); // this will not pass validation, (equivalent to 'groups: undefined', see above)
```

There is also a special flag `always: true` in validation options that you can use. This flag says that this validation
must be applied always no matter which group is used.

## Custom validation classes

If you have custom validation logic you can create a *Constraint class*:

1. First create a file, lets say `CustomTextLength.ts`, and define a new class:

    ```javascript
    import {ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    @ValidatorConstraint({ name: "customText", async: false })
    export class CustomTextLength implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

        validate(text: string, args: ValidationArguments) {
            return text.length > 1 && text.length < 10; // for async validations you must return a Promise<boolean> here
        }

        defaultMessage(args: ValidationArguments) { // here you can provide default error message if validation failed
            return "Text ($value) is too short or too long!";
        }

    }
    ```

    We marked our class with `@ValidatorConstraint` decorator.
    You can also supply a validation constraint name - this name will be used as "error type" in ValidationError.
    If you will not supply a constraint name - it will be auto-generated.

    Our class must implement `ValidatorConstraintInterface` interface and its `validate` method,
    which defines validation logic. If validation succeeds, method returns true, otherwise false.
    Custom validator can be asynchronous, if you want to perform validation after some asynchronous
    operations, simply return a promise with boolean inside in `validate` method.

    Also we defined optional method `defaultMessage` which defines a default error message,
    in the case that the decorator's implementation doesn't set an error message.


2. Then you can use your new validation constraint in your class:

    ```javascript
    import {Validate} from "class-validator";
    import {CustomTextLength} from "./CustomTextLength";

    export class Post {

        @Validate(CustomTextLength, {
            message: "Title is too short or long!"
        })
        title: string;

    }
    ```

    Here we set our newly created `CustomTextLength` validation constraint for `Post.title`.

3. And use validator as usual:

    ```javascript
    import {validate} from "class-validator";

    validate(post).then(errors => {
        // ...
    });
    ```

You can also pass constraints to your validator, like this:

```javascript
import {Validate} from "class-validator";
import {CustomTextLength} from "./CustomTextLength";

export class Post {

    @Validate(CustomTextLength, [3, 20], {
        message: "Wrong post title"
    })
    title: string;

}
```

And use them from `validationArguments` object:

```javascript
import {ValidationArguments, ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface} from "class-validator";

@ValidatorConstraint()
export class CustomTextLength implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

    validate(text: string, validationArguments: ValidationArguments) {
        return text.length > validationArguments.constraints[0] && text.length < validationArguments.constraints[1];
    }

}
```

## Custom validation decorators

You can also create a custom decorators. Its the most elegant way of using a custom validations.
Lets create a decorator called `@IsLongerThan`:

1. Create a decorator itself:

    ```javascript
    import {registerDecorator, ValidationOptions, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    export function IsLongerThan(property: string, validationOptions?: ValidationOptions) {
       return function (object: Object, propertyName: string) {
            registerDecorator({
                name: "isLongerThan",
                target: object.constructor,
                propertyName: propertyName,
                constraints: [property],
                options: validationOptions,
                validator: {
                    validate(value: any, args: ValidationArguments) {
                        const [relatedPropertyName] = args.constraints;
                        const relatedValue = (args.object as any)[relatedPropertyName];
                        return  typeof value === "string" &&
                               typeof relatedValue === "string" &&
                               value.length > relatedValue.length; // you can return a Promise<boolean> here as well, if you want to make async validation
                    }
                }
            });
       };
    }
    ```

2. Put it to use:

    ```javascript
    import {IsLongerThan} from "./IsLongerThan";

    export class Post {

        title: string;

        @IsLongerThan("title", {
           /* you can also use additional validation options, like "groups" in your custom validation decorators. "each" is not supported */
           message: "Text must be longer than the title"
        })
        text: string;

    }
    ```

In your custom decorators you can also use `ValidationConstraint`.
Lets create another custom validation decorator called `IsUserAlreadyExist`:

1. Create a ValidationConstraint and decorator:

    ```javascript
    import {registerDecorator, ValidationOptions, ValidatorConstraint, ValidatorConstraintInterface, ValidationArguments} from "class-validator";

    @ValidatorConstraint({ async: true })
    export class IsUserAlreadyExistConstraint implements ValidatorConstraintInterface {

        validate(userName: any, args: ValidationArguments) {
            return UserRepository.findOneByName(userName).then(user => {
                if (user) return false;
                return true;
            });
        }

    }

    export function IsUserAlreadyExist(validationOptions?: ValidationOptions) {
       return function (object: Object, propertyName: string) {
            registerDecorator({
                target: object.constructor,
                propertyName: propertyName,
                options: validationOptions,
                constraints: [],
                validator: IsUserAlreadyExistConstraint
            });
       };
    }
    ```

    note that we marked our constraint that it will by async by adding `{ async: true }` in validation options.

2. And put it to use:

    ```javascript
    import {IsUserAlreadyExist} from "./IsUserAlreadyExist";

    export class User {

        @IsUserAlreadyExist({
           message: "User $value already exists. Choose another name."
        })
        name: string;

    }
    ```

## Using service container

Validator supports service container in the case if want to inject dependencies into your custom validator constraint
classes. Here is example how to integrate it with [typedi][2]:

```javascript
import {Container} from "typedi";
import {useContainer, Validator} from "class-validator";

// do this somewhere in the global application level:
useContainer(Container);
let validator = Container.get(Validator);

// now everywhere you can inject Validator class which will go from the container
// also you can inject classes using constructor injection into your custom ValidatorConstraint-s
```

## Synchronous validation

If you want to perform a simple non async validation you can use `validateSync` method instead of regular `validate`
 method. It has the same arguments as `validate` method. But note, this method **ignores** all async validations
 you have.

## Manual validation

There are several method exist in the Validator that allows to perform non-decorator based validation:

```javascript
import {isEmpty, isBoolean} from "class-validator";

isEmpty(value);
isBoolean(value);
```

## Validation decorators

| Decorator                                       | Description                                                                                                                      |

| `@IsDefined(value: any)`                        | Checks if value is defined (!== undefined, !== null). This is the only decorator that ignores skipMissingProperties option.      |
| `@IsOptional()`                                 | Checks if given value is empty (=== null, === undefined) and if so, ignores all the validators on the property.                         |

| `@IsIn(values: any[])`                          | Checks if value is in a array of allowed values.                                                                                 |
| `@IsNotIn(values: any[])`                       | Checks if value is not in a array of disallowed values.                                                                          |

| `@IsBoolean()`                                  | Checks if a value is a boolean.                                                                                                  |
| `@IsDate()`                                     | Checks if the value is a date.                                                                                                   |

| `@IsNumber(options: IsNumberOptions)`           | Checks if the value is a number.                                                                                                 |
| `@IsInt()`                                      | Checks if the value is an integer number.                                                                                        |
| `@IsArray()`                                    | Checks if the value is an array                                                                                                  |
| `@IsEnum(entity: object)`                         | Checks if the value is an valid enum                                                                                           |

## Defining validation schema without decorators

You can define your validation schemas without decorators:

* you can define it in the separate object
* you can define it in the `.json` file

This feature maybe useful in the cases if:

* are using es5/es6 and don't have decorators available
* you don't have a classes, and instead using interfaces
* you don't want to use model at all
* you want to have a validation schema separate of your model
* you want beautiful json-schema based validation models
* you simply hate decorators

Here is an example of using it:

1. Create a schema object:

    ```javascript
    import {ValidationSchema} from "class-validator";
    export let UserValidationSchema: ValidationSchema = { // using interface here is not required, its just for type-safety
        name: "myUserSchema", // this is required, and must be unique
        properties: {
            firstName: [{
                type: "minLength", // validation type. All validation types are listed in ValidationTypes class.
                constraints: [2]
            }, {
                type: "maxLength",
                constraints: [20]
            }],
            lastName: [{
                type: "minLength",
                constraints: [2]
            }, {
                type: "maxLength",
                constraints: [20]
            }],
            email: [{
                type: "isEmail"
            }]
        }
    };
    ```

    Same schema can be provided in `.json` file, depend on your wish.

2. Register your schema:

    ```javascript
    import {registerSchema} from "class-validator";
    import {UserValidationSchema} from "./UserValidationSchema";
    registerSchema(UserValidationSchema); // if schema is in .json file, then you can simply do registerSchema(require("path-to-schema.json"));
    ```

    Better to put this code in a global place, maybe when you bootstrap your application, for example in `app.ts`.

3. Validate your object using validation schema:

    ```javascript
    import {validate} from "class-validator";
    const user = { firstName: "Johny", secondName: "Cage", email: "johny@cage.com" };
    validate("myUserSchema", user).then(errors => {
        if (errors.length > 0) {
            console.log("Validation failed: ", errors);
        } else {
            console.log("Validation succeed.");
        }
    });
    ```

    That's it. Here `"myUserSchema"` is the name of our validation schema.
    `validate` method will perform validation based on this schema

## Validating plain objects
Due to nature of the decorators, the validated object has to be instantiated using `new Class()` syntax. If you have your class defined using class-validator decorators and you want to validate plain JS object (literal object or returned by JSON.parse), you need to transform it to the class instance (e.g. using [class-transformer](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer)) or just use the [class-transformer-validator](https://github.com/19majkel94/class-transformer-validator) extension which can do that for you.

## Samples

Take a look on samples in [./sample](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator/tree/master/sample) for more examples of
usages.

## Extensions
There are several extensions that simplify class-validator integration with other modules:
- [class-validator integration](https://github.com/19majkel94/class-transformer-validator) with [class-transformer](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer)
- [class-validator-rule](https://github.com/yantrab/class-validator-rule)
- [ngx-dynamic-form-builder](https://github.com/EndyKaufman/ngx-dynamic-form-builder)

```js
import consola from 'consola/src/node'
import consola from 'consola/src/browser'
```

## Methods

#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`

Log to all reporters.

Example: `consola.info('Message')`

A list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).

#### `addReporter(reporter)`

- Aliases: `add`

Register a custom reporter instance.

#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`

- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`

Remove a registered reporter.

If no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.

#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`

Replace all reporters.

#### `create(options)`

Create a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.

#### `withDefaults(defaults)`

Create a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults

#### `withTag(tag)`

- Aliases: `withScope`

Create a new `Consola` instance with that tag.

#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`

Globally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.

#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`

Globally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.

#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`

Wrap both, std and console.

console uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.
Benefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.

#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`

- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`

**Globally** pause and resume logs.

Consola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.

#### `mockTypes`

- Aliases: `mock`

Mock all types. Useful for using with tests.

The first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())
```

Please note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:

```js
const fn = jest.fn()
consola.mockTypes(() => fn)
```

If callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.

For example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn())
```

**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.
This way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.

## Fields

#### `reporters`

An array of active reporters.

#### `level`

The level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.
List of available levels [here](./src/types.js).

You can set log level using `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable.

## `logObject`

The `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.

Standard fields:

- `message`
- `additional`
- `args`
- `date`
- `tag`

Extra fields:

- `badge`

## Reporters

Choose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.

By default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.

Available reporters:

- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)
- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)
- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)
- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)

### Creating your own reporter

A reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.
To get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.

## Types

Types are used to actually log messages to the reporters.
Each type is attached to a _logging level_.

A list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).

## Creating a new instance

Consola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.
In case more control is needed, create a new instance.

```js
import consola from 'consola'

const logger = consola.create({
    // level: 4,
    reporters: [
      new consola.JSONReporter()
    ],
    defaults: {
      additionalColor: 'white'
    }
})
```

## Integrations

### With jest

```js
describe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
      // Redirect std and console to consola too
      // Calling this once is sufficient
      consola.wrapAll()
    })

    beforeEach(() => {
      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove
      // calls from before
      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())
    })


  test('your test', async () => {
    // Some code here

    // Let's retrieve all messages of `consola.log`
    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument
    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])
    expect(consolaMessages).toContain('your message')
  })

})
```

### With jsdom

```js
{
  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)
}
```

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

GPL version 3
=============

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge (node-forge@0.9.1). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program

The following software may be included in this product: seek-bzip@1.0.5.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/cscott/seek-bzip (seek-bzip@1.0.5). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# seek-bzip

[![Build Status][1]][2] [![dependency status][3]][4] [![dev dependency status][5]][6]

`seek-bzip` is a pure-javascript Node.JS module adapted from [node-bzip](https://github.com/skeggse/node-bzip) and before that [antimatter15's pure-javascript bzip2 decoder](https://github.com/antimatter15/bzip2.js).  Like these projects, `seek-bzip` only does decompression (see [compressjs](https://github.com/cscott/compressjs) if you need compression code).  Unlike those other projects, `seek-bzip` can seek to and decode single blocks from the bzip2 file.

`seek-bzip` primarily decodes buffers into other buffers, synchronously.
With the help of the [fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers)
package, it can operate on node streams; see `test/stream.js` for an
example.

## How to Install

```
npm install seek-bzip
```

This package uses
[Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays), which are present in node.js >= 0.5.5.

## Usage

After compressing some example data into `example.bz2`, the following will recreate that original data and save it to `example`:

```
var Bunzip = require('seek-bzip');
var fs = require('fs');

var compressedData = fs.readFileSync('example.bz2');
var data = Bunzip.decode(compressedData);

fs.writeFileSync('example', data);
```

See the tests in the `tests/` directory for further usage examples.

For uncompressing single blocks of bzip2-compressed data, you will need
an out-of-band index listing the start of each bzip2 block.  (Presumably
you generate this at the same time as you index the start of the information
you wish to seek to inside the compressed file.)  The `seek-bzip` module
has been designed to be compatible with the C implementation `seek-bzip2`
available from https://bitbucket.org/james_taylor/seek-bzip2.  That codebase
contains a `bzip-table` tool which will generate bzip2 block start indices.
There is also a pure-JavaScript `seek-bzip-table` tool in this package's
`bin` directory.

## Documentation

`require('seek-bzip')` returns a `Bunzip` object.  It contains three static
methods.  The first is a function accepting one or two parameters:

`Bunzip.decode = function(input, [Number expectedSize] or [output], [boolean multistream])`

The `input` argument can be a "stream" object (which must implement the
`readByte` method), or a `Buffer`.

If `expectedSize` is not present, `decodeBzip` simply decodes `input` and
returns the resulting `Buffer`.

If `expectedSize` is present (and numeric), `decodeBzip` will store
the results in a `Buffer` of length `expectedSize`, and throw an error
in the case that the size of the decoded data does not match
`expectedSize`.

If you pass a non-numeric second parameter, it can either be a `Buffer`
object (which must be of the correct length; an error will be thrown if
the size of the decoded data does not match the buffer length) or
a "stream" object (which must implement a `writeByte` method).

The optional third `multistream` parameter, if true, attempts to continue
reading past the end of the bzip2 file.  This supports "multistream"
bzip2 files, which are simply multiple bzip2 files concatenated together.
If this argument is true, the input stream must have an `eof` method
which returns true when the end of the input has been reached.

The second exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters:

`Bunzip.decodeBlock = function(input, Number blockStartBits, [Number expectedSize] or [output])`

The `input` and `expectedSize`/`output` parameters are as above.
The `blockStartBits` parameter gives the start of the desired block, in bits.

If passing a stream as the `input` parameter, it must implement the
`seek` method.

The final exported method is a function accepting two or three parameters:

`Bunzip.table = function(input, Function callback, [boolean multistream])`

The `input` and `multistream` parameters are identical to those for the
`decode` method.

This function will invoke `callback(position, size)` once per bzip2 block,
where `position` gives the starting position of the block (in *bits*), and
`size` gives the uncompressed size of the block (in bytes).

This can be used to construct an index allowing direct access to a particular
block inside a bzip2 file, using the `decodeBlock` method.

## Command-line
There are binaries available in bin.  The first generates an index of all
the blocks in a bzip2-compressed file:
```
$ bin/seek-bzip-table test/sample4.bz2
32	99981
320555	99981
606348	99981
847568	99981
1089094	99981
1343625	99981
1596228	99981
1843336	99981
2090919	99981
2342106	39019
$
```
The first field is the starting position of the block, in bits, and the
second field is the length of the block, in bytes.

The second binary decodes an arbitrary block of a bzip2 file:
```
$ bin/seek-bunzip -d -b 2342106 test/sample4.bz2 | tail
élan's
émigré
émigré's
émigrés
épée
épée's
épées
étude
étude's
études
$
```

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following software may be included in this product: @apollographql/graphql-playground-html@1.6.26.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground (@apollographql/graphql-playground-html@1.6.26). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# @apollographql/graphql-playground-html

**NOTE:** This is a fork of [`graphql-playground-html`](https://npm.im/graphql-playground-html) which is meant to be used by Apollo Server and only by Apollo Server.  It is not intended to be used directly.  Those looking to use GraphQL Playground directly can refer to [the upstream repository](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground) for usage instructions.

> **SECURITY WARNING:** Via the upstream fork, this package had a severe XSS Reflection attack vulnerability until version `1.6.25` of this package. **While we have published a fix, users were only affected if they were using `@apollographql/graphql-playground-html` directly as their own custom middleware.**  The direct usage of this package was never recommended as it provided no advantage over the upstream package in that regard.  Users of Apollo Server who leverage this package automatically by the dependency declared within Apollo Sever were not affected since Apollo Server never provided dynamic facilities to customize playground options per request.  Users of Apollo Server would have had to statically embedded very explicit vulnerabilities (e.g., using malicious, unescaped code, `<script>` tags, etc.).

## Description

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a powerful query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It's an elegant approach that solves many problems typically found with REST APIs. For background, we suggest reading this [comparison](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-vs-rest-5d425123e34b) between GraphQL and REST. GraphQL combined with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) helps you develop better type safety with your GraphQL queries, giving you end-to-end typing.

## Installation

If you are using `express` HTTP engine, install the following packages:

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/graphql apollo-server-express graphql
```

In case of `fastify`, you should install `apollo-server-fastify` instead.

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/graphql apollo-server-fastify graphql
```

## Description

Mapped Types module for [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) used by the `@nestjs/graphql` and `@nestjs/swagger` packages.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/mapped-types
```

## Quick Start

As you build out features, it's often useful to construct variants on a base entity type. A good example of such a variant is a **Data Transfer Object** (DTO). A Data Transfer Object is an object that is used to encapsulate data, and send it from one part of your application to another. DTO’s help us define the input and output interfaces of our system.

Let's imagine a real-world example, where we typically need to build both a **create** and **update** variations for the same entity type.

The create variant may require all fields, while the update variant may make all fields **optional**. Not to mention, both these types can also be variants of an entity type (to some extent).

That's a lot of redundant code!

Thus, [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) now provides several utility functions that perform type transformations to help us avoid doing this, and make life a little bit easier.

Available mapped types:

- `PartialType` - returns a type (class) with all the properties of the input type set to optional (requirement: at least 1 validation decorator applied to each property)
- `PickType` - constructs a new type (class) by picking a set of properties from an input type
- `OmitType` - constructs a type by picking all properties from an input type and then removing a particular set of keys
- `IntersectionType` - combines two types into one new type (class)

The following software may be included in this product: agent-base@4.2.1.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base (agent-base@4.2.1).

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

# apollo-upload-client

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/apollo-upload-client)](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-client) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/actions)

A terminating [Apollo Link](https://apollographql.com/docs/link) for [Apollo Client](https://apollographql.com/docs/link/#apollo-client) that allows [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList), [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) or [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances within query or mutation variables and sends [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

## Setup

Install with [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```shell
npm install apollo-upload-client
```

[Apollo Boost](https://npm.im/apollo-boost) doesn’t allow link customization; if you are using it [migrate to a manual Apollo Client setup](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/boost-migration).

[Apollo Client](https://apollographql.com/docs/link/#apollo-client) can only have 1 “terminating” [Apollo Link](https://apollographql.com/docs/link) that sends the GraphQL requests; if one such as [`apollo-link-http`](https://apollographql.com/docs/link/links/http) is already setup, remove it.

Initialize the client with a terminating link using [`createUploadLink`](#function-createuploadlink).

Also ensure the GraphQL server implements the [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) and that uploads are handled correctly in resolvers.

## Usage

Use [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList), [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) or [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances anywhere within query or mutation variables to send a [GraphQL multipart request](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

See also the [example API and client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-examples).

### [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList)

```jsx
const { useMutation } = require('@apollo/react-hooks');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

const MUTATION = gql`
  mutation($files: [Upload!]!) {
    uploadFiles(files: $files) {
      success
    }
  }
`;

function UploadFiles() {
  const [mutate] = useMutation(MUTATION);

  function onChange({ target: { validity, files } }) {
    if (validity.valid) mutate({ variables: { files } });
  }

  return <input type="file" multiple required onChange={onChange} />;
}
```

### [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)

```jsx
const { useMutation } = require('@apollo/react-hooks');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

const MUTATION = gql`
  mutation($file: Upload!) {
    uploadFile(file: $file) {
      success
    }
  }
`;

function UploadFile() {
  const [mutate] = useMutation(MUTATION);

  function onChange({
    target: {
      validity,
      files: [file],
    },
  }) {
    if (validity.valid) mutate({ variables: { file } });
  }

  return <input type="file" required onChange={onChange} />;
}
```

### [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)

```jsx
const { useMutation } = require('@apollo/react-hooks');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');

const MUTATION = gql`
  mutation($file: Upload!) {
    uploadFile(file: $file) {
      success
    }
  }
`;

function UploadFile() {
  const [mutate] = useMutation(MUTATION);

  function onChange({ target: { validity, value } }) {
    if (validity.valid) {
      const file = new Blob([value], { type: 'text/plain' });

      // Optional, defaults to `blob`.
      file.name = 'text.txt';

      mutate({ variables: { file } });
    }
  }

  return <input type="text" required onChange={onChange} />;
}
```

| `value`   | \*   | Value to check. |

**Returns:** boolean — Is the value an extractable file.

#### See

- [`isExtractableFile`](#function-isextractablefile) has this type.

#### Examples

_How to check for the default exactable files, as well as a custom type of file._

> ```js
> const { isExtractableFile } = require('apollo-upload-client');
>
> const isExtractableFileEnhanced = (value) =>
>   isExtractableFile(value) ||
>   (typeof CustomFile !== 'undefined' && value instanceof CustomFile);
> ```

### type FetchOptions

GraphQL request `fetch` options.

**Type:** object

| Property      | Type    | Description                      |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------------------------- |
| `headers`     | object  | HTTP request headers.            |
| `credentials` | string? | Authentication credentials mode. |

#### See

- [Polyfillable fetch options](https://github.github.io/fetch#options).

---

### type FormDataFileAppender

Appends a file extracted from the GraphQL operation to the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) instance used as the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch) `options.body` for the [GraphQL multipart request](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `formData` | FormData | [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) instance to append the specified file to. |
| `fieldName` | string | Field name for the file. |
| `file` | \* | File to append. The file type depends on what the [`ExtractableFileMatcher`](#type-extractablefilematcher) extracts. |

#### See

- [`formDataAppendFile`](#function-formdataappendfile) has this type.
- [`createUploadLink`](#function-createuploadlink) accepts this type in `options.formDataAppendFile`.

---

### type ReactNativeFileSubstitute

A React Native [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) substitute.

Be aware that inspecting network requests with Chrome dev tools interferes with the React Native `FormData` implementation, causing network errors.

**Type:** object

| Property | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `uri` | string | Filesystem path. |
| `name` | string? | File name. |
| `type` | string? | File content type. Some environments (particularly Android) require a valid MIME type; Expo `ImageResult.type` is unreliable as it can be just `image`. |

#### See

- [`extract-files` `ReactNativeFileSubstitute` docs](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files#type-reactnativefilesubstitute).
- [React Native `FormData` polyfill source](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/v0.45.1/Libraries/Network/FormData.js#L34).

#### Examples

_A camera roll file._

> ```js
> {
>   uri: uriFromCameraRoll,
>   name: 'a.jpg',
>   type: 'image/jpeg'
> }
> ```

Its ES6 and Typescript era. Nowadays you are working with classes and constructor objects more then ever.
Class-transformer allows you to transform plain object to some instance of class and versa.
Also it allows to serialize / deserialize object based on criteria.
This tool is super useful on both frontend and backend.

Example how to use with angular 2 in [plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/Mja1ZYAjVySWASMHVB9R).
Source code is available [here](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer-demo).

## What is class-transformer

In JavaScript there are two types of objects:

* plain (literal) objects
* class (constructor) objects

Plain objects are objects that are instances of `Object` class.
Sometimes they are called **literal** objects, when created via `{}` notation.
Class objects are instances of classes with own defined constructor, properties and methods.
Usually you define them via `class` notation.

So, what is the problem?

Sometimes you want to transform plain javascript object to the ES6 **classes** you have.
For example, if you are loading a json from your backend, some api or from a json file,
and after you `JSON.parse` it you have a plain javascript object, not instance of class you have.

For example you have a list of users in your `users.json` that you are loading:

```json
[{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "Johny",
  "lastName": "Cage",
  "age": 27
},
{
  "id": 2,
  "firstName": "Ismoil",
  "lastName": "Somoni",
  "age": 50
},
{
  "id": 3,
  "firstName": "Luke",
  "lastName": "Dacascos",
  "age": 12
}]
```
And you have a `User` class:

```javascript
export class User {
    id: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;

    getName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    isAdult() {
        return this.age > 36 && this.age < 60;
    }
}
```

You are assuming that you are downloading users of type `User` from `users.json` file and may want to write
following code:

```javascript
fetch("users.json").then((users: User[]) => {
    // you can use users here, and type hinting also will be available to you,
    //  but users are not actually instances of User class
    // this means that you can't use methods of User class
});
```

In this code you can use `users[0].id`, you can also use `users[0].firstName` and `users[0].lastName`.
However you cannot use `users[0].getName()` or `users[0].isAdult()` because "users" actually is
array of plain javascript objects, not instances of User object.
You actually lied to compiler when you said that its `users: User[]`.

So what to do? How to make a `users` array of instances of `User` objects instead of plain javascript objects?
Solution is to create new instances of User object and manually copy all properties to new objects.
But things may go wrong very fast once you have a more complex object hierarchy.

Alternatives? Yes, you can use class-transformer. Purpose of this library is to help you to map you plain javascript
objects to the instances of classes you have.

This library also great for models exposed in your APIs,
because it provides a great tooling to control what your models are exposing in your API.
Here is example how it will look like:

```javascript
fetch("users.json").then((users: Object[]) => {
    const realUsers = plainToClass(User, users);
    // now each user in realUsers is instance of User class
});
```

Now you can use `users[0].getName()` and `users[0].isAdult()` methods.

## Installation

### Node.js

1. Install module:

    `npm install class-transformer --save`

2. `reflect-metadata` shim is required, install it too:

    `npm install reflect-metadata --save`

    and make sure to import it in a global place, like app.ts:

    ```javascript
    import "reflect-metadata";
    ```

3. ES6 features are used, if you are using old version of node.js you may need to install es6-shim:

   `npm install es6-shim --save`

   and import it in a global place like app.ts:

    ```javascript
    import "es6-shim";
    ```

### Browser

1. Install module:

    `npm install class-transformer --save`

2. `reflect-metadata` shim is required, install it too:

    `npm install reflect-metadata --save`

    add `<script>` to reflect-metadata in the head of your `index.html`:

    ```html
    <html>
       <head>
           <!-- ... -->
           <script src="node_modules/reflect-metadata/Reflect.js"></script>
       </head>
       <!-- ... -->
    </html>
    ```

    If you are using angular 2 you should already have this shim installed.

3. If you are using system.js you may want to add this into `map` and `package` config:

    ```json
    {
        "map": {
            "class-transformer": "node_modules/class-transformer"
        },
        "packages": {
            "class-transformer": { "main": "index.js", "defaultExtension": "js" }
        }
    }
    ```

## Methods

#### plainToClass

This method transforms a plain javascript object to instance of specific class.

```javascript
import {plainToClass} from "class-transformer";

let users = plainToClass(User, userJson); // to convert user plain object a single user. also supports arrays
```

#### plainToClassFromExist

This method transforms a plain object into a instance using a already filled Object which is a instance from the target class.

```javascript
const defaultUser = new User();
defaultUser.role = 'user';

let mixedUser = plainToClassFromExist(defaultUser, user); // mixed user should have the value role = user when no value is set otherwise.
```

#### classToPlain

This method transforms your class object back to plain javascript object, that can be `JSON.stringify` later.

```javascript
import {classToPlain} from "class-transformer";
let photo = classToPlain(photo);
```

#### classToClass

This method transforms your class object into new instance of the class object.
This maybe treated as deep clone of your objects.

```javascript
import {classToClass} from "class-transformer";
let photo = classToClass(photo);
```

You can also use a `ignoreDecorators` option in transformation options to ignore all decorators you classes is using.

#### serialize

You can serialize your model right to the json using `serialize` method:

```javascript
import {serialize} from "class-transformer";
let photo = serialize(photo);
```

`serialize` works with both arrays and non-arrays.

#### deserialize and deserializeArray

You can deserialize your model to from a json using `deserialize` method:

```javascript
import {deserialize} from "class-transformer";
let photo = deserialize(Photo, photo);
```

To make deserialization to work with arrays use `deserializeArray` method:

```javascript
import {deserializeArray} from "class-transformer";
let photos = deserializeArray(Photo, photos);
```

## Enforcing type-safe instance

The default behaviour of the `plainToClass` method is to set *all* properties from the plain object,
even those which are not specified in the class.

```javascript
import {plainToClass} from "class-transformer";

class User {
  id: number
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

const fromPlainUser = {
  unkownProp: 'hello there',
  firstName: 'Umed',
  lastName: 'Khudoiberdiev',
}

console.log(plainToClass(User, fromPlainUser))

// User {
//   unkownProp: 'hello there',
//   firstName: 'Umed',
//   lastName: 'Khudoiberdiev',
// }
```

If this behaviour does not suit your needs, you can use the `excludeExtraneousValues` option
in the `plainToClass` method while *exposing all your class properties* as a requirement.

```javascript
import {Expose, plainToClass} from "class-transformer";

class User {
    @Expose() id: number;
    @Expose() firstName: string;
    @Expose() lastName: string;
}

const fromPlainUser = {
  unkownProp: 'hello there',
  firstName: 'Umed',
  lastName: 'Khudoiberdiev',
}

console.log(plainToClass(User, fromPlainUser, { excludeExtraneousValues: true }))

// User {
//   id: undefined,
//   firstName: 'Umed',
//   lastName: 'Khudoiberdiev'
// }
```

## Working with nested objects

When you are trying to transform objects that have nested objects,
its required to known what type of object you are trying to transform.
Since Typescript does not have good reflection abilities yet,
we should implicitly specify what type of object each property contain.
This is done using `@Type` decorator.

Lets say we have an album with photos.
And we are trying to convert album plain object to class object:

```javascript
import {Type, plainToClass} from "class-transformer";

export class Album {

    id: number;

    name: string;

    @Type(() => Photo)
    photos: Photo[];
}

export class Photo {
    id: number;
    filename: string;
}

let album = plainToClass(Album, albumJson);
// now album is Album object with Photo objects inside
```

### Providing more than one type option

In case the nested object can be of different types, you can provide an additional options object,
that specifies a discriminator. The discriminator option must define a `property` that holds the sub
type name for the object and the possible `subTypes`, the nested object can converted to. A sub type
has a `value`, that holds the constructor of the Type and the `name`, that can match with the `property`
of the discriminator.

Lets say we have an album that has a top photo. But this photo can be of certain different types.
And we are trying to convert album plain object to class object. The plain object input has to define
the additional property `__type`. This property is removed during transformation by default:

**JSON input**:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "foo",
    "topPhoto": {
        "id": 9,
        "filename": "cool_wale.jpg",
        "depth": 1245,
        "__type": "underwater"
    }
}
```

```javascript
import {Type, plainToClass} from "class-transformer";

export abstract class Photo {
    id: number;
    filename: string;
}

export class Landscape extends Photo {
    panorama: boolean;
}

export class Portrait extends Photo {
    person: Person;
}

export class UnderWater extends Photo {
    depth: number;
}

export class Album {

    id: number;
    name: string;

    @Type(() => Photo, {
        discriminator: {
            property: "__type",
            subTypes: [
                { value: Landscape, name: "landscape" },
                { value: Portrait, name: "portrait" },
                { value: UnderWater, name: "underwater" }
            ]
        }
    })
    topPhoto: Landscape | Portrait | UnderWater;

}

let album = plainToClass(Album, albumJson);
// now album is Album object with a UnderWater object without `__type` property.
```

Hint: The same applies for arrays with different sub types. Moreover you can specify `keepDiscriminatorProperty: true`
in the options to keep the discriminator property also inside your resulting class.

## Exposing getters and method return values

You can expose what your getter or method return by setting a `@Expose()` decorator to those getters or methods:

```javascript
import {Expose} from "class-transformer";

export class User {

    id: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    password: string;

    @Expose()
    get name() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

    @Expose()
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}
```

## Exposing properties with different names

If you want to expose some of properties with a different name,
you can do it by specifying a `name` option to `@Expose` decorator:

```javascript
import {Expose} from "class-transformer";

export class User {

    @Expose({ name: "uid" })
    id: number;

    firstName: string;

    lastName: string;

    @Expose({ name: "secretKey" })
    password: string;

    @Expose({ name: "fullName" })
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}
```

## Skipping specific properties

Sometimes you want to skip some properties during transformation.
This can be done using `@Exclude` decorator:

```javascript
import {Exclude} from "class-transformer";

export class User {

    id: number;

    email: string;

    @Exclude()
    password: string;
}
```

Now when you transform a User, `password` property will be skipped and not be included in the transformed result.

## Skipping depend of operation

You can control on what operation you will exclude a property. Use `toClassOnly` or `toPlainOnly` options:

```javascript
import {Exclude} from "class-transformer";

export class User {

    id: number;

    email: string;

    @Exclude({ toPlainOnly: true })
    password: string;
}
```

Now `password` property will be excluded only during `classToPlain` operation. Oppositely, use `toClassOnly` option.

## Skipping all properties of the class

You can skip all properties of the class, and expose only those are needed explicitly:

```javascript
import {Exclude, Expose} from "class-transformer";

@Exclude()
export class User {

    @Expose()
    id: number;

    @Expose()
    email: string;

    password: string;
}
```

Now `id` and `email` will be exposed, and password will be excluded during transformation.
Alternatively, you can set exclusion strategy during transformation:

```javascript
import {classToPlain} from "class-transformer";
let photo = classToPlain(photo, { strategy: "excludeAll" });
```

In this case you don't need to `@Exclude()` a whole class.

## Skipping private properties, or some prefixed properties

If you name your private properties with a prefix, lets say with `_`,
then you can exclude such properties from transformation too:

```javascript
import {classToPlain} from "class-transformer";
let photo = classToPlain(photo, { excludePrefixes: ["_"] });
```

This will skip all properties that start with `_` prefix.
You can pass any number of prefixes and all properties that begin with these prefixes will be ignored.
For example:

```javascript
import {Expose} from "class-transformer";

export class User {

    id: number;
    private _firstName: string;
    private _lastName: string;
    _password: string;

    setName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
        this._firstName = firstName;
        this._lastName = lastName;
    }

    @Expose()
    get name() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }

}

const user = new User();
user.id = 1;
user.setName("Johny", "Cage");
user._password = 123;

const plainUser = classToPlain(user, { excludePrefixes: ["_"] });
// here plainUser will be equal to
// { id: 1, name: "Johny Cage" }
```

## Using groups to control excluded properties

You can use groups to control what data will be exposed and what will not be:

```javascript
import {Exclude, Expose} from "class-transformer";

@Exclude()
export class User {

    id: number;

    name: string;

    @Expose({ groups: ["user", "admin"] }) // this means that this data will be exposed only to users and admins
    email: string;

    @Expose({ groups: ["user"] }) // this means that this data will be exposed only to users
    password: string;
}
```

```javascript
import {classToPlain} from "class-transformer";
let user1 = classToPlain(user, { groups: ["user"] }); // will contain id, name, email and password
let user2 = classToPlain(user, { groups: ["admin"] }); // will contain id, name and email
```

## Using versioning to control exposed and excluded properties

If you are building an API that has different versions, class-transformer has extremely useful tools for that.
You can control which properties of your model should be exposed or excluded in what version. Example:

```javascript
import {Exclude, Expose} from "class-transformer";

@Exclude()
export class User {

    id: number;

    name: string;

    @Expose({ since: 0.7, until: 1 }) // this means that this property will be exposed for version starting from 0.7 until 1
    email: string;

    @Expose({ since: 2.1 }) // this means that this property will be exposed for version starting from 2.1
    password: string;
}
```

```javascript
import {classToPlain} from "class-transformer";
let user1 = classToPlain(user, { version: 0.5 }); // will contain id and name
let user2 = classToPlain(user, { version: 0.7 }); // will contain id, name and email
let user3 = classToPlain(user, { version: 1 }); // will contain id and name
let user4 = classToPlain(user, { version: 2 }); // will contain id and name
let user5 = classToPlain(user, { version: 2.1 }); // will contain id, name nad password
```

## Сonverting date strings into Date objects

Sometimes you have a Date in your plain javascript object received in a string format.
And you want to create a real javascript Date object from it.
You can do it simply by passing a Date object to the `@Type` decorator:

```javascript
import {Type} from "class-transformer";

export class User {

    id: number;

    email: string;

    password: string;

    @Type(() => Date)
    registrationDate: Date;
}
```

Note, that dates will be converted to strings when you'll try to convert class object to plain object.

Same technique can be used with `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`
primitive types when you want to convert your values into these types.

## Working with arrays

When you are using arrays you must provide a type of the object that array contains.
This type, you specify in a `@Type()` decorator:

```javascript
import {Type} from "class-transformer";

export class Photo {

    id: number;

    name: string;

    @Type(() => Album)
    albums: Album[];
}
```

You can also use custom array types:

```javascript
import {Type} from "class-transformer";

export class AlbumCollection extends Array<Album> {
    // custom array functions ...
}

export class Photo {

    id: number;

    name: string;

    @Type(() => Album)
    albums: AlbumCollection;
}
```

Library will handle proper transformation automatically.

ES6 collections `Set` and `Map` also require the `@Type` decorator:

```javascript
export class Skill {
    name: string;
}

export class Weapon {
    name: string;
    range: number;
}

export class Player {
    name: string;

    @Type(() => Skill)
    skills: Set<Skill>;

    @Type(() => Weapon)
    weapons: Map<string, Weapon>;
}
```

## Additional data transformation

### Basic usage

You can perform additional data transformation using `@Transform` decorator.
For example, you want to make your `Date` object to be a `moment` object when you are
transforming object from plain to class:

```javascript
import {Transform} from "class-transformer";
import * as moment from "moment";
import {Moment} from "moment";

export class Photo {

    id: number;

    @Type(() => Date)
    @Transform(value => moment(value), { toClassOnly: true })
    date: Moment;
}
```

Now when you call `plainToClass` and send a plain representation of the Photo object,
it will convert a date value in your photo object to moment date.
`@Transform` decorator also supports groups and versioning.

### Advanced usage

The `@Transform` decorator is given more arguments to let you configure how you want the transformation to be done.

```
@Transform((value, obj, type) => value)
```

| Argument          | Description
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `value` | The property value before the transformation.
| `obj` | The transformation source object.
| `type` | The transformation type.

## Other decorators
| Signature          | Example                                  | Description
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `@TransformClassToPlain` | `@TransformClassToPlain({ groups: ["user"] })` | Transform the method return with classToPlain and expose the properties on the class.
| `@TransformClassToClass` | `@TransformClassToClass({ groups: ["user"] })` | Transform the method return with classToClass and expose the properties on the class.
| `@TransformPlainToClass` | `@TransformPlainToClass(User, { groups: ["user"] })` | Transform the method return with plainToClass and expose the properties on the class.

The above decorators accept one optional argument:
ClassTransformOptions - The transform options like groups, version, name

An example:

```javascript
@Exclude()
class User {

    id: number;

    @Expose()
    firstName: string;

    @Expose()
    lastName: string;

    @Expose({ groups: ['user.email'] })
    email: string;

    password: string;
}

class UserController {

    @TransformClassToPlain({ groups: ['user.email'] })
    getUser() {
        const user = new User();
        user.firstName = "Snir";
        user.lastName = "Segal";
        user.password = "imnosuperman";

        return user;
    }
}

const controller = new UserController();
const user = controller.getUser();
```

the `user` variable will contain only firstName,lastName, email properties becuase they are
the exposed variables. email property is also exposed becuase we metioned the group "user.email".

## Working with generics

Generics are not supported because TypeScript does not have good reflection abilities yet.
Once TypeScript team provide us better runtime type reflection tools, generics will be implemented.
There are some tweaks however you can use, that maybe can solve your problem.
[Checkout this example.](https://github.com/pleerock/class-transformer/tree/master/sample/sample4-generics)

## Implicit type conversion

> **NOTE** If you use class-validator together with class-transformer you propably DON'T want to enable this function.

Enables automatic conversion between built-in types based on type information provided by Typescript. Disabled by default.

```ts
import { IsString } from 'class-validator'

class MyPayload {

  @IsString()
  prop: string
}


const result1 = plainToClass(MyPayload, { prop: 1234 }, { enableImplicitConversion: true });
const result2 = plainToClass(MyPayload, { prop: 1234 }, { enableImplicitConversion: false });

/**
 *  result1 will be `{ prop: "1234" }` - notice how the prop value has been converted to string.
 *  result2 will be `{ prop: 1234 }` - default behaviour
 */
```

## How does it handle circular references?

Circular references are ignored.
For example, if you are transforming class `User` that contains property `photos` with type of `Photo`,
 and `Photo` contains link `user` to its parent `User`, then `user` will be ignored during transformation.
Circular references are not ignored only during `classToClass` operation.

## Example with Angular2

Lets say you want to download users and want them automatically to be mapped to the instances of `User` class.

```javascript
import {plainToClass} from "class-transformer";

this.http
    .get("users.json")
    .map(res => res.json())
    .map(res => plainToClass(User, res as Object[]))
    .subscribe(users => {
        // now "users" is type of User[] and each user has getName() and isAdult() methods available
        console.log(users);
    });
```

You can also inject a class `ClassTransformer` as a service in `providers`, and use its methods.

The following software may be included in this product: deprecated-decorator@0.1.6.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/vilic/deprecated-decorator (deprecated-decorator@0.1.6). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

[![NPM Package](https://badge.fury.io/js/deprecated-decorator.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deprecated-decorator)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vilic/deprecated-decorator.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vilic/deprecated-decorator) 

# Deprecated Decorator

A simple decorator for deprecated properties, methods and classes. It can also wrap normal functions via the old-fashioned way.

Transpilers supported:

- **TypeScript** with `experimentalDecorators` option enabled.
- **Babel** with [transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) for version 6.x.

## Install

```sh
npm install deprecated-decorator --save
```

## API References

```ts
export declare type DeprecatedDecorator = ClassDecorator & PropertyDecorator;

export interface DeprecatedOptions {
    alternative?: string;
    version?: string;
    url?: string;
}

export declare function deprecated(options?: DeprecatedOptions): DeprecatedDecorator;
export declare function deprecated(alternative?: string, version?: string, url?: string): DeprecatedDecorator;

export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(options: DeprecatedOptions, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, fn: T): T;
export declare function deprecated<T extends Function>(alternative: string, version: string, url: string, fn: T): T;

export default deprecated;
```

## Usage

Decorating a class will enable warning on constructor and static methods (including static getters and setters):

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

// alternative, since version, url
@deprecated('Bar', '0.1.0', 'http://vane.life/')
class Foo {
    static method() { }
}
```

Or you can decorate methods respectively:

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

class Foo {
    @deprecated('otherMethod')
    method() { }
    
    @deprecated({
        alternative: 'otherProperty',
        version: '0.1.2',
        url: 'http://vane.life/'
    })
    get property() { }
}
```

For functions:

```ts
import deprecated from 'deprecated-decorator';

let foo = deprecated({
    alternative: 'bar',
    version: '0.1.0'
}, function foo() {
    // ...
});
```

Create new error instances with a code and additional properties.


## Installation

`$ npm install err-code` - `NPM`   
`$ bower install err-code` - `bower`

The browser file is named index.umd.js which supports CommonJS, AMD and globals (errCode).


## Why

I find myself doing this repeatedly:

```js
var err = new Error('My message');
err.code = 'SOMECODE';
err.detail = 'Additional information about the error';
throw err;
```


## Usage

Simple usage.

```js
var errcode = require('err-code');

// fill error with message + code
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE');
// fill error with message + code + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// fill error with message + props
throw errcode(new Error('My message'), { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });


// You may also pass a string in the first argument and an error will be automatically created
// for you, though the stack trace will contain err-code in it.

// create error with message + code
throw errcode('My message', 'ESOMECODE');
// create error with message + code + props
throw errcode('My message', 'ESOMECODE', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
// create error with message + props
throw errcode('My message', { detail: 'Additional information about the error' });
```

# es6-promisify

Converts callback-based functions to Promise-based functions.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/es6-promisify)

```bash
npm install --save es6-promisify
```

## Example

```js
"use strict";

// Declare variables
const promisify = require("es6-promisify");
const fs = require("fs");

// Convert the stat function
const stat = promisify(fs.stat);

// Now usable as a promise!
stat("example.txt").then(function (stats) {
    console.log("Got stats", stats);
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.error("Yikes!", err);
});
```

## Promisify methods
```js
"use strict";

// Declare variables
const promisify = require("es6-promisify");
const redis = require("redis").createClient(6379, "localhost");

// Create a promise-based version of send_command
const client = promisify(redis.send_command, redis);

// Send commands to redis and get a promise back
client("ping").then(function (pong) {
    console.log("Got", pong);
}).catch(function (err) {
    console.error("Unexpected error", err);
}).then(function () {
    redis.quit();
});
```

## Handle callback multiple arguments
```js
"use strict";

// Declare functions
function test(cb) {
    return cb(undefined, 1, 2, 3);
}

// Declare variables
const promisify = require("es6-promisify");

// Create promise-based version of test
const single = promisify(test);
const multi = promisify(test, {multiArgs: true});

// Discards additional arguments
single().then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // 1
});

// Returns all arguments as an array
multi().then(function (result) {
    console.log(result); // [1, 2, 3]
});
```

The following software may be included in this product: extract-files@8.1.0.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files (extract-files@8.1.0). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# extract-files

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/extract-files)](https://npm.im/extract-files) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/actions)

Clones a value, recursively extracting [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/blob) and [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances with their [object paths](#type-objectpath), replacing them with `null`. [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/filelist) instances are treated as [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file) instance arrays.

Used by [GraphQL multipart request spec client implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#implementations) such as [`graphql-react`](https://npm.im/graphql-react) and [`apollo-upload-client`](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-client).

## Usage

Install with [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```shell
npm install extract-files
```

See the [`extractFiles`](#function-extractfiles) documentation to get started.

## Support

- Node.js `10 - 12 || >= 13.7`
- Browsers [`> 0.5%, not OperaMini all, not dead`](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+0.5%25%2C+not+OperaMini+all%2C+not+dead)

### class ReactNativeFile

Used to mark a [React Native `File` substitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute) in an object tree for [`extractFiles`](#function-extractfiles). It’s too risky to assume all objects with `uri`, `type` and `name` properties are files to extract.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `file` | [ReactNativeFileSubstitute](#type-reactnativefilesubstitute) | A React Native [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file) substitute. |

#### Examples

_An extractable file in React Native._

> ```js
> import { ReactNativeFile } from 'extract-files';
>
> const file = new ReactNativeFile({
>   uri: uriFromCameraRoll,
>   name: 'a.jpg',
>   type: 'image/jpeg',
> });
> ```

---

### function extractFiles

Clones a value, recursively extracting [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file), [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/blob) and [`ReactNativeFile`](#class-reactnativefile) instances with their [object paths](#type-objectpath), replacing them with `null`. [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/filelist) instances are treated as [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/api/file) instance arrays.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `value` | \* | Value (typically an object tree) to extract files from. |
| `path` | [ObjectPath](#type-objectpath)? = `''` | Prefix for object paths for extracted files. |
| `isExtractableFile` | [ExtractableFileMatcher](#type-extractablefilematcher)? = [isExtractableFile](#function-isextractablefile) | The function used to identify extractable files. |

**Returns:** [ExtractFilesResult](#type-extractfilesresult) — Result.

#### Examples

_Extract files from an object._

> For the following:
>
> ```js
> import { extractFiles } from 'extract-files';
>
> const file1 = new File(['1'], '1.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
> const file2 = new File(['2'], '2.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
> const value = {
>   a: file1,
>   b: [file1, file2],
> };
>
> const { clone, files } = extractFiles(value, 'prefix');
> ```
>
> `value` remains the same.
>
> `clone` is:
>
> ```js
> {
>   a: null,
>   b: [null, null]
> }
> ```
>
> `files` is a [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) instance containing:
>
> | Key     | Value                        |
> | :------ | :--------------------------- |
> | `file1` | `['prefix.a', 'prefix.b.0']` |

The following software may be included in this product: fs-capacitor@2.0.4.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor (fs-capacitor@2.0.4). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mike-marcacci/fs-capacitor) [![Current version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/fs-capacitor)](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) ![Supported Node.js versions](https://badgen.net/npm/node/fs-capacitor)

# FS Capacitor

FS Capacitor is a filesystem buffer for finite node streams. It supports simultaneous read/write, and can be used to create multiple independent readable streams, each starting at the beginning of the buffer.

This is useful for file uploads and other situations where you want to avoid delays to the source stream, but have slow downstream transformations to apply:

```js
import fs from "fs";
import http from "http";
import WriteStream from "fs-capacitor";

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const capacitor = new WriteStream();
  const destination = fs.createReadStream("destination.txt");

  // pipe data to the capacitor
  req.pipe(capacitor);

  // read data from the capacitor
  capacitor
    .createReadStream()
    .pipe(/* some slow Transform streams here */)
    .pipe(destination);

  // read data from the very beginning
  setTimeout(() => {
    capacitor.createReadStream().pipe(/* elsewhere */);

    // you can destroy a capacitor as soon as no more read streams are needed
    // without worrying if existing streams are fully consumed
    capacitor.destroy();
  }, 100);
});
```

It is especially important to use cases like [`graphql-upload`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload) where server code may need to stash earler parts of a stream until later parts have been processed, and needs to attach multiple consumers at different times.

FS Capacitor creates its temporary files in the directory ideneified by `os.tmpdir()` and attempts to remove them:

- after `readStream.destroy()` has been called and all read streams are fully consumed or destroyed
- before the process exits

Please do note that FS Capacitor does NOT release disk space _as data is consumed_, and therefore is not suitable for use with infinite streams or those larger than the filesystem.

## API

### WriteStream

`WriteStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.WriteStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_writestream)

#### `new WriteStream()`

Create a new `WriteStream` instance.

#### `.createReadStream(): ReadStream`

Create a new `ReadStream` instance attached to the `WriteStream` instance.

Once a `WriteStream` is fully destroyed, calling `.createReadStream()` will throw a `ReadAfterDestroyedError` error.

As soon as a `ReadStream` ends or is closed (such as by calling `readStream.destroy()`), it is detached from its `WriteStream`.

#### `.destroy(error?: ?Error): void`

- If `error` is present, `WriteStream`s still attached are destroyed with the same error.
- If `error` is null or undefined, destruction of underlying resources is delayed until no `ReadStream`s are attached the `WriteStream` instance.

### ReadStream

`ReadStream` inherets all the methods of [`fs.ReadStream`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_readstream).

[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/graphql-upload)](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) [![CI status](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/actions)

Middleware and an [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to add support for [GraphQL multipart requests](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) (file uploads via queries and mutations) to various Node.js GraphQL servers.

⚠️ Previously published as [`apollo-upload-server`](https://npm.im/apollo-upload-server).

## Support

The following environments are known to be compatible:

- Node.js v8.5+
  - CJS
  - Native ESM with [`--experimental-modules`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_enabling)
- [Koa](https://koajs.com)
  - [`graphql-api-koa`](https://npm.im/graphql-api-koa)
  - [`koa-graphql`](https://npm.im/koa-graphql)
  - [`apollo-server-koa`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-koa) (inbuilt)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - [`express-graphql`](https://npm.im/express-graphql)
  - [`apollo-server-express`](https://npm.im/apollo-server-express) (inbuilt)

See also [GraphQL multipart request spec server implementations](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#server).

## Setup

Setup is necessary if your environment doesn’t feature this package inbuilt (see **_[Support](#support)_**).

To install [`graphql-upload`](https://npm.im/graphql-upload) and the [`graphql`](https://npm.im/graphql) peer dependency from [npm](https://npmjs.com) run:

```shell
npm install graphql-upload graphql
```

Use the [`graphqlUploadKoa`](#function-graphqluploadkoa) or [`graphqlUploadExpress`](#function-graphqluploadexpress) middleware just before GraphQL middleware. Alternatively, use [`processRequest`](#function-processrequest) to create custom middleware.

A schema built with separate SDL and resolvers (e.g. using [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)) requires the [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) to be setup.

## Usage

[Clients implementing the GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec#client) upload files as [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) query or mutation variables. Their resolver values are promises that resolve [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage. Files are typically streamed into cloud storage but may also be stored in the filesystem.

See the [example API and client](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-examples).

### Tips

- The process must have both read and write access to the directory identified by [`os.tmpdir()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_tmpdir).
- The device requires sufficient disk space to buffer the expected number of concurrent upload requests.
- Promisify and await file upload streams in resolvers or the server will send a response to the client before uploads are complete, causing a disconnect.
- Handle file upload promise rejection and stream errors; uploads sometimes fail due to network connectivity issues or impatient users disconnecting.
- Process multiple uploads asynchronously with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/promise/all) or a more flexible solution where an error in one does not reject them all.
- Only use [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload) _before_ the resolver returns; late calls (e.g. in an unawaited async function or callback) throw an error. Existing streams can still be used after a response is sent, although there are few valid reasons for not awaiting their completion.
- Use [`stream.destroy()`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_destroy_error) when an incomplete stream is no longer needed, or temporary files may not get cleaned up.

## Architecture

The [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) allows a file to be used for multiple query or mutation variables (file deduplication), and for variables to be used in multiple places. GraphQL resolvers need to be able to manage independent file streams. As resolvers are executed asynchronously, it’s possible they will try to process files in a different order than received in the multipart request.

[`busboy`](https://npm.im/busboy) parses multipart request streams. Once the `operations` and `map` fields have been parsed, [`Upload` scalar](#class-graphqlupload) values in the GraphQL operations are populated with promises, and the operations are passed down the middleware chain to GraphQL resolvers.

[`fs-capacitor`](https://npm.im/fs-capacitor) is used to buffer file uploads to the filesystem and coordinate simultaneous reading and writing. As soon as a file upload’s contents begins streaming, its data begins buffering to the filesystem and its associated promise resolves. GraphQL resolvers can then create new streams from the buffer by calling [`createReadStream()`](#type-fileupload). The buffer is destroyed once all streams have ended or closed and the server has responded to the request. Any remaining buffer files will be cleaned when the process exits.

## API

### Table of contents

- [class GraphQLUpload](#class-graphqlupload)
- [function graphqlUploadExpress](#function-graphqluploadexpress)
- [function graphqlUploadKoa](#function-graphqluploadkoa)
- [function processRequest](#function-processrequest)
- [type FileUpload](#type-fileupload)
- [type GraphQLOperation](#type-graphqloperation)
- [type ProcessRequestFunction](#type-processrequestfunction)
- [type ProcessRequestOptions](#type-processrequestoptions)

### class GraphQLUpload

A GraphQL `Upload` scalar that can be used in a [`GraphQLSchema`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema). It’s value in resolvers is a promise that resolves [file upload details](#type-fileupload) for processing and storage.

#### Examples

_Setup for a schema built with [`makeExecutableSchema`](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema#makeExecutableSchema)._

> ```js
> import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools'
> import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload'
>
> const typeDefs = `
>   scalar Upload
> `
>
> const resolvers = {
>   Upload: GraphQLUpload
> }
>
> export const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })
> ```

_A manually constructed schema with an image upload mutation._

> ```js
> import { GraphQLSchema, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLBoolean } from 'graphql'
> import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload'
>
> export const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
>   mutation: new GraphQLObjectType({
>     name: 'Mutation',
>     fields: {
>       uploadImage: {
>         description: 'Uploads an image.',
>         type: GraphQLBoolean,
>         args: {
>           image: {
>             description: 'Image file.',
>             type: GraphQLUpload
>           }
>         },
>         async resolve(parent, { image }) {
>           const { filename, mimetype, createReadStream } = await image
>           const stream = createReadStream()
>           // Promisify the stream and store the file, then…
>           return true
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   })
> })
> ```

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following software may be included in this product: run-queue@1.0.3.
A copy of the source code may be downloaded from https://github.com/iarna/run-queue (run-queue@1.0.3). 
This software contains the following license and notice below:

# run-queue

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```

would output

```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```

If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:

```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```

The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:

```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value >= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.

socks-proxy-agent
================
### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a
specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http`
or `https` modules.

It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket
connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the "Examples" section below.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install socks-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `http` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

http.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var opts = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);
opts.agent = agent;

https.get(opts, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');

// SOCKS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);

// initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```
